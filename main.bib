Specifically, we represent state-level time series data for COVID-19 and Google search trends for symptoms as smoothed functional curves. Given these functional data, we explore the modes of variation in the data using functional principal component analysis (FPCA). We also apply functional clustering analysis to identify patterns of COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories across the US. Moreover, we quantify the associations between Google COVID-19 search trends for symptoms and COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories using dynamic correlation. Finally, we examine the dynamics of correlations for the top nine Google search trends of symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 confirmed case and death trajectories. Our results reveal and characterize distinct patterns for COVID-19 spread and mortality across the US. The dynamics of these correlations suggest the feasibility of using Google queries to forecast COVID-19 cases and mortality for up to three weeks in advance. Our results and analysis framework set the stage for the development of predictive models for forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths using historical data and Google search trends for nine symptoms associated with both outcomes.},

While vaccines are primarily aimed at reducing COVID-19 transmission and mortality risks, they may have important secondary benefits. We use data from U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey merged to state-level COVID-19 vaccination eligibility data to estimate the secondary benefits of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health outcomes. To address endogenous COVID-19 vaccination, we leverage state-level variation in the timing of when age groups are eligible for vaccination. We estimate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces anxiety and depression symptoms by nearly 30\%. Nearly all the benefits are private benefits, and we find little evidence of spillover effects, that is, increases in community vaccination rates are not associated with improved anxiety or depression symptoms among the unvaccinated. We find that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with larger reductions in anxiety or depression symptoms among individuals with lower education levels, who rent their housing, who are not able to telework, and who have children in their household. The economic benefit of reductions in anxiety and depression are approximately \$350 billion. Our results highlight an important, but understudied, secondary benefit of COVID-19 vaccinations.},

Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21\textendash 40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).},

  abstract = {Background The surgical burden of disease is substantial, but little is known about the associated economic consequences. We estimate the global macroeconomic impact of the surgical burden of disease due to injury, neoplasm, digestive diseases, and maternal and neonatal disorders from two distinct economic perspectives. Methods We obtained mortality rate estimates for each disease for the years 2000 and 2010 from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease 2010 study, and estimates of the proportion of the burden of the selected diseases that is surgical from a paper by Shrime and colleagues. We first used the value of lost output (VLO) approach, based on the WHO's Projecting the Economic Cost of Ill-Health (EPIC) model, to project annual market economy losses due to these surgical diseases during 2015\textendash 30. EPIC attempts to model how disease affects a country's projected labour force and capital stock, which in turn are related to losses in economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP). We then used the value of lost welfare (VLW) approach, which is conceptually based on the value of a statistical life and is inclusive of non-market losses, to estimate the present value of long-run welfare losses resulting from mortality and short-run welfare losses resulting from morbidity incurred during 2010. Sensitivity analyses were performed for both approaches. Findings During 2015\textendash 30, the VLO approach projected that surgical conditions would result in losses of 1{$\cdot$}25\% of potential GDP, or \$20{$\cdot$}7 trillion (2010 US\$, purchasing power parity) in the 128 countries with data available. When expressed as a proportion of potential GDP, annual GDP losses were greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, with up to a 2{$\cdot$}5\% loss in output by 2030. When total welfare losses are assessed (VLW), the present value of economic losses is estimated to be equivalent to 17\% of 2010 GDP, or \$14{$\cdot$}5 trillion in the 175 countries assessed with this approach. Neoplasm and injury account for greater than 95\% of total economic losses with each approach, but maternal, digestive, and neonatal disorders, which represent only 4\% of losses in high-income countries with the VLW approach, contribute to 26\% of losses in low-income countries. Interpretation The macroeconomic impact of surgical disease is substantial and inequitably distributed. When paired with the growing number of favourable cost-effectiveness analyses of surgical interventions in low-income and middle-income countries, our results suggest that building surgical capacity should be a global health priority.

  abstract = {Accurate forecasting of emerging infectious diseases can guide public health officials inmaking appropriate decisions related to the allocation of public health resources. Due to the exponential spread of the COVID- 19 infection worldwide, several computational models for forecasting the transmission and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been proposed in the literature. To accelerate scientific and public health insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19, Google released the Google COVID-19 search trends symptoms open-access dataset. Our objective is to develop 7 and 14-day-ahead forecasting models of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in the US using the Google search trends for COVID-19 related symptoms. Specifically,we propose a stacked long short-termmemory (SLSTM) architecture for predicting COVID-19 confirmed and death cases using historical time series data combined with auxiliary time series data from theGoogle COVID- 19 search trends symptoms dataset. Considering the SLSTM networks trained using historical data only as the base models, our base models for 7 and 14- day-ahead forecasting of COVID cases had the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 6.6\% and 8.8\%, respectively. On the other side, our proposed models had improvedMAPE values of 3.2\% and 5.6\%, respectively. For 7 and 14 -day-ahead forecasting of COVID-19 deaths, the MAPE values of the base models were 4.8\% and 11.4\%, while the improved MAPE values of our proposed models were 4.7\% and 7.8\%, respectively. We found that the Google search trends for "pneumonia," "shortness of breath," and "fever" are the most informative search trends for predicting COVID-19 transmission. We also found that the search trends for "hypoxia" and "fever"were the most informative trends for forecasting COVID-19 mortality.},

Further, an understanding of patterns in and between exposure metrics that are based on specific hazards of the storm can help in designing tropical cyclone epidemiological research. Objectives: a) Provide an open-source data set for tropical cyclone exposure assessment for epidemiological research; and b) investigate patterns and agreement between county-level assessments of tropical cyclone exposure based on different storm hazards. Methods: We created an open-source data set with data at the county level on exposure to four tropical cyclone hazards: peak sustained wind, rainfall, flooding, and tornadoes. The data cover all eastern U.S. counties for all land-falling or near-land Atlantic basin storms, covering 1996\textendash 2011 for all metrics and up to 1988\textendash 2018 for specific metrics. We validated measurements against other data sources and investigated patterns and agreement among binary exposure classifications based on these metrics, as well as compared them to use of distance from the storm's track, which has been used as a proxy for exposure in some epidemiological studies. Results: Our open-source data set was typically consistent with data from other sources, and we present and discuss areas of disagreement and other caveats. Over the study period and area, tropical cyclones typically brought different hazards to different counties. Therefore, when comparing exposure assessment between different hazard-specific metrics, agreement was usually low, as it also was when comparing exposure assessment based on a distance-based proxy measurement and any of the hazard-specific metrics. Discussion: Our results provide a multihazard data set that can be leveraged for epidemiological research on tropical cyclones, as well as insights that can inform the design and analysis for tropical cyclone epidemiological research. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6976},

In both studies, both Trump and Biden voters reported negative attitudes toward the rioters, but those attitudes became significantly more positive from Study 1 to Study 2 in both groups. As expected, in both studies, Trump/Pence voters had less confidence in, and satisfaction with, the election results, which correlated with more positive attitudes toward the rioters and the president. Biden/Harris voters held more positive beliefs about the election, which correlated with more negative attitudes toward the rioters and the president. In both studies, Biden voters were more likely to report feeling fear, disgust, anger, and sadness than Trump voters, who were more likely to report feeling joy and surprise. Unexpectedly, across all voters and within voting groups, more people in Study 2 reported feeling each emotion, compared with Study 1.},

Climate change has been shown to affect mental health as a result of disruption of social and economic structures that populations depend on for good health, including mental health. After decades of neglect, recent efforts by governments such as in Kenya to address the twin issues of climate change and mental health demonstrate the growing importance of these issues. Here we briefly review the evidence of climate change impacts on mental health in Africa and demonstrate that there is need for more contextual awareness and research in this area in Africa to mitigate or forestall potential mental health crises in the near future. We recommend systematic efforts to support funding for research and interventions at the nexus between climate change and mental health in Africa, and urge institutions and governments in Africa to begin paying attention to this emerging threat to the health of African populations.},

  abstract = {Suicide is a worldwide phenomenon. This review is based on a literature search of the World Health Organization (WHO) databases and PubMed. According to the WHO, in 2015, about 800,000 suicides were documented worldwide, and globally 78\% of all completed suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. Overall, suicides account for 1.4\% of premature deaths worldwide. Differences arise between regions and countries with respect to the age, gender, and socioeconomic status of the individual and the respective country, method of suicide, and access to health care. During the second and third decades of life, suicide is the second leading cause of death. Completed suicides are three times more common in males than females; for suicide attempts, an inverse ratio can be found. Suicide attempts are up to 30 times more common compared to suicides; they are however important predictors of repeated attempts as well as completed suicides. Overall, suicide rates vary among the sexes and across lifetimes, whereas methods differ according to countries. The most commonly used methods are hanging, self-poisoning with pesticides, and use of firearms. The majority of suicides worldwide are related to psychiatric diseases. Among those, depression, substance use, and psychosis constitute the most relevant risk factors, but also anxiety, personality-, eating- and trauma-related disorders as well as organic mental disorders significantly add to unnatural causes of death compared to the general population. Overall, the matter at hand is relatively complex and a significant amount of underreporting is likely to be present. Nevertheless, suicides can, at least partially, be prevented by restricting access to means of suicide, by training primary care physicians and health workers to identify people at risk as well as to assess and manage respective crises, provide adequate follow-up care and address the way this is reported by the media. Suicidality represents a major societal and health care problem; it thus should be given a high priority in many realms.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess accessibility and affordability of health care in eight countries of the former Soviet Union. Data Sources/Study Setting Primary data collection conducted in 2010 in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. Study Design Cross-sectional household survey using multistage stratified random sampling. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Data were collected using standardized questionnaires with subjects aged 18+ on demographic, socioeconomic, and health care access characteristics. Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were used. Principal Findings Almost half of respondents who had a health problem in the previous month which they viewed as needing care had not sought care. Respondents significantly less likely to seek care included those living in Armenia, Georgia, or Ukraine, in rural areas, aged 35\textendash 49, with a poor household economic situation, and high alcohol consumption. Cost was most often cited as the reason for not seeking health care. Most respondents who did obtain care made out-of-pocket payments, with median amounts varying from \$13 in Belarus to \$100 in Azerbaijan. Conclusions Access to health care and within-country inequalities appear to have improved over the past decade. However, considerable problems remain, including out-of-pocket payments and unaffordability despite efforts to improve financial protection.},

Social isolation, loneliness, fear of infection, bereavement, and financial concerns have contributed to the observed rise in anxiety and depression. The pandemic, the necessary public health interventions, and the negative impact on economic activity had long-lasting effects on people's mental health. This chapter reviews the literature on COVID-19 and mental well-being. It first examines the role of public health measures, school lockdowns, economic uncertainty, and changes in working arrangements, as well as the effects of vaccine rollout. The second part of the chapter explores the heterogeneity of the COVID-19 impact in the population, documenting alarming tends in the mental health of the most vulnerable populations such as young adults, women, families with children, minorities, and essential workers.},

First, CBT reduces vulnerability to deteriorating mental health; and second, CBT directly improves bandwidth, increasing cognitive and socioemotional skills and hence economic outcomes.},

Many studies have examined this relationship in urban environments, with fewer focused on rural settings. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise quantitative evidence for the relationship between environmental factors (drought, climate and extreme weather events, land use/environmental degradation, green space/vegetation, engagement in natural resource management activities) and mental health or well-being in rural areas. Design Following a systematic search of three databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Web of Science), 4368 articles were identified, of which 28 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. Results Poorer mental health and well-being was typically found to have an association with extreme climate or weather events and environmental degradation. The observed relationships were largely assessed at area-wide or community levels. Conclusions Studies examining the relationship between the environmental condition of land and mental health at an individual level, particularly within farms, are lacking. Addressing this gap in research requires interdisciplinary expertise and diverse methodology. Few studies examined the effects of natural resource management practices/principles or biodiversity on mental health. While there is evidence that extreme climate or weather events have a negative impact on mental health in rural areas, there remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of how rural environments influence mental health and well-being.},

Design, setting, participants Longitudinal cohort study; seven fortnightly online surveys of a representative sample of 1296 Australian adults from the beginning of COVID-19-related restrictions in late March 2020 to mid-June 2020. Main outcome measures Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales; trajectories of symptom change. Results Younger age, being female, greater COVID-19-related work and social impairment, COVID-19-related financial distress, having a neurological or mental illness diagnosis, and recent adversity were each significantly associated with higher baseline depression and anxiety scores. Growth mixture models identified three latent trajectories for depression symptoms (low throughout the study, 81\% of participants; moderate throughout the study, 10\%; initially severe then declining, 9\%) and four for anxiety symptoms (low throughout the study, 77\%; initially moderate then increasing, 10\%; initially moderate then declining, 5\%; initially mild then increasing before again declining, 8\%). Factors statistically associated with not having a low symptom trajectory included mental disorder diagnoses, COVID-19-related financial distress and social and work impairment, and bushfire exposure. Conclusion Our longitudinal data enabled identification of distinct symptom trajectories during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Early intervention to ensure that vulnerable people are clinically and socially supported during a pandemic should be a priority.},

However, decisions about vaccination are based on more than mere knowledge of risks, costs, and benefits. Individual decision making about vaccinating involves many other factors including those related to emotion, culture, religion, and socio-political context. In this paper, we use a nationally representative internet survey in the U.S. to investigate socio-political characteristics to assess attitudes about vaccination. In particular, we consider how political ideology and trust affect opinions about vaccinations for flu, pertussis, and measles. Our findings demonstrate that ideology has a direct effect on vaccine attitudes. In particular, conservative respondents are less likely to express pro-vaccination beliefs than other individuals. Furthermore, ideology also has an indirect effect on immunization propensity. The ideology variable predicts an indicator capturing trust in government medical experts, which in turn helps to explain individual-level variation with regards to attitudes about vaccine choice.},

  abstract = {Background Efficacious psychiatric treatments are not consistently deployed in community practice, and clinical outcomes are attenuated compared with those achieved in clinical trials. A major focus for mental health services research is to develop effective and cost-effective strategies that increase the use of evidence-based assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches in community settings. Objective The goal of this program of research is to apply insights from behavioral economics and participatory design to advance the science and practice of implementing evidence-based practice (EBP) for individuals with psychiatric disorders across the life span. Methods Project 1 (Assisting Depressed Adults in Primary care Treatment [ADAPT]) is patient-focused and leverages decision-making heuristics to compare ways to incentivize adherence to antidepressant medications in the first 6 weeks of treatment among adults newly diagnosed with depression. Project 2 (App for Strengthening Services In Specialized Therapeutic Support [ASSISTS]) is provider-focused and utilizes normative pressure and social status to increase data collection among community mental health workers treating children with autism. Project 3 (Motivating Outpatient Therapists to Implement: Valuing a Team Effort [MOTIVATE]) explores how participatory design can be used to design organizational-level implementation strategies to increase clinician use of EBPs. The projects are supported by a Methods Core that provides expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, participatory design, measurement, and associated statistical approaches. Results Enrollment for project ADAPT started in 2018; results are expected in 2020. Enrollment for project ASSISTS will begin in 2019; results are expected in 2021. Enrollment for project MOTIVATE started in 2018; results are expected in 2019. Data collection had begun for ADAPT and MOTIVATE when this protocol was submitted. Conclusions This research will advance the science of implementation through efforts to improve implementation strategy design, measurement, and statistical methods. First, we will test and refine approaches to collaboratively design implementation strategies with stakeholders (eg, discrete choice experiments and innovation tournaments). Second, we will refine the measurement of mechanisms related to heuristics used in decision making. Third, we will develop new ways to test mechanisms in multilevel implementation trials. This trifecta, coupled with findings from our 3 exploratory projects, will lead to improvements in our knowledge of what causes successful implementation, what variables moderate and mediate the effects of those causal factors, and how best to leverage this knowledge to increase the quality of care for people with psychiatric disorders.

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models' capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a `hybrid' model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions\textemdash notably random slopes\textemdash we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

We incorporate measures of disease prevalence into a human capital augmented production function, which enables us to determine the economic burden of chronic health conditions in terms of foregone gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike earlier frameworks, this approach allows us to account for i) variations in human capital for workers in different age groups, ii) mortality and morbidity effects of non-communicable diseases, and iii) the treatment costs of diseases. We apply our methodology to China, Japan, and South Korea, and estimate the economic burden of chronic conditions in five domains (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions). Overall, total losses associated with these diseases over the period 2010\textendash 2030 are (measured in real USD with the base year 2010) estimated to be \$7.7 trillion for China, \$3.5 trillion for Japan, and \$1 trillion for South Korea.},

We argue that WHO began to refashion itself as the coordinator, strategic planner, and leader of global health initiatives as a strategy of survival in response to this transformed international political context.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 physical distancing measures can potentially increase the likelihood of mental disorders. It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff {$\geqslant$}10). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Meta-analysis and meta-regression. RESULTS: In total, 226 638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.0\% and 21.3\%, respectively. There were differences in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported across regions and countries. Asia (17.6\% and 17.9\%), and China (16.2\% and 15.5\%) especially, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased the prevalence of anxiety, especially in Europe. LIMITATIONS: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e. city-specific) contexts. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provide support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.},

This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities\textemdash assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

We explore differences between cause-specific and excess mortality of MNSDs estimated by GBD 2010. METHODS: GBD 2010 cause-specific death estimates were produced using the International Classification of Diseases death-coding system. Excess mortality (all-cause) was estimated using natural history models. Additional mortality attributed to MNSDs as underlying causes but not captured through GBD 2010 methodology is quantified in the comparative risk assessments. RESULTS: In GBD 2010, MNSDs were estimated to be directly responsible for 840 000 deaths compared with more than 13 million excess deaths using natural history models. CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of excess deaths and attributable deaths clearly demonstrate the high degree of mortality associated with these disorders. There is substantial evidence pointing to potential causal pathways for this premature mortality with evidence-based interventions available to address this mortality. The life expectancy gap between persons with MNSDs and the general population is high and should be a focus for health systems reform.},

The literature on climate change and mental health is growing rapidly but is characterised by several limitations and research gaps. In a field where the need for designing evidence-based adaptation strategies is urgent, and research gaps are vast, implementing a broad, all-encompassing research agenda will require some strategic focus. Methods We followed a structured approach to prioritise future climate change and mental health research. We consulted with experts working across mental health and climate change, both within and outside of research and working in high, middle, and low-income countries, to garner consensus about the future research priorities for mental health and climate change. Experts were identified based on whether they had published work on climate change and mental health, worked in governmental and non-governmental organisations on climate change and mental health, and from the professional networks of the authors who have been active in the mental health and climate change space. Results Twenty-two experts participated from across low- and middle-income countries (n~=~4) and high-income countries (n~=~18). Our process identified ten key priorities for progressing research on mental health and climate change. Conclusion While climate change is considered the biggest threat to global mental health in the coming century, tackling this threat could be the most significant opportunity to shape our mental health for centuries to come because of health co-benefits of transitioning to more sustainable ways of living. Research on the impacts of climate change on mental health and mental health-related systems will assist decision-makers to develop robust evidence-based mitigation and adaptation policies and plans with the potential for broad benefits to society and the environment.},

  abstract = {The potential impacts of sea level rise (SLR) due to climate change have been widely studied in the literature. However, the uncertainty and robustness of these estimates has seldom been explored. Here we assess the model input uncertainty regarding the wide effects of SLR on marine navigation from a global economic perspective. We systematically assess the robustness of computable general equilibrium (CGE) estimates to model's inputs uncertainty. Monte Carlo (MC) and Gaussian quadrature (GQ) methods are used for conducting a Systematic sensitivity analysis (SSA). This design allows to both explore the sensitivity of the CGE model and to compare the MC and GQ methods. Results show that, regardless whether triangular or piecewise linear Probability distributions are used, the welfare losses are higher in the MC SSA than in the original deterministic simulation. This indicates that the CGE economic literature has potentially underestimated the total economic effects of SLR, thus stressing the necessity of SSA when simulating the general equilibrium effects of SLR. The uncertainty decomposition shows that land losses have a smaller effect compared to capital and seaport productivity losses. Capital losses seem to affect the developed regions GDP more than the productivity losses do. Moreover, we show the uncertainty decomposition of the MC results and discuss the convergence of the MC results for a decomposed version of the CGE model. This paper aims to provide standardised guidelines for stochastic simulation in the context of CGE modelling that could be useful for researchers in similar settings.},

  abstract = {Importance: Forgetfulness is a major contributor to nonadherence to chronic disease medications and could be addressed with medication reminder devices. Objective: To compare the effect of 3 low-cost reminder devices on medication adherence. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 4-arm, block-randomized clinical trial involved 53\,480 enrollees of CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager, across the United States. Eligible participants were aged 18 to 64 years and taking 1 to 3 oral medications for long-term use. Participants had to be suboptimally adherent to all of their prescribed therapies (with a medication possession ratio of 30\% to 80\%) in the 12 months before randomization. Participants were stratified on the basis of the medications they were using at randomization: medications for cardiovascular or other nondepression chronic conditions (the chronic disease stratum) and antidepressants (the antidepressant stratum). In each stratum, randomization occurred within blocks defined by whether all of the patient's targeted medications were dosed once daily. Patients were randomized to receive in the mail a pill bottle strip with toggles, digital timer cap, or standard pillbox. The control group received neither notification nor a device. Data were collected from February 12, 2013, through March 21, 2015, and data analyses were on the intention-to-treat population. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was optimal adherence (medication possession ratio {$\geq$}80\%) to all eligible medications among patients in the chronic disease stratum during 12 months of follow-up, ascertained using pharmacy claims data. Secondary outcomes included optimal adherence to cardiovascular medications among patients in the chronic disease stratum as well as optimal adherence to antidepressants. Results: Of the 53\,480 participants, mean (SD) age was 45 (12) years and 56\% were female. In the primary analysis, 15.5\% of patients in the chronic disease stratum assigned to the standard pillbox, 15.1\% assigned to the digital timer cap, 16.3\% assigned to the pill bottle strip with toggles, and 15.1\% assigned to the control arm were optimally adherent to their prescribed treatments during follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of optimal adherence between the control and any of the devices (standard pillbox: odds ratio [OR],\,1.03 [95\% CI, 0.95-1.13]; digital timer cap: OR,\,1.00 [95\% CI, 0.92-1.09]; and pill bottle strip with toggles: OR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.85-1.04]). In direct comparisons, the odds of optimal adherence were higher with a standard pillbox than with the pill bottle strip (OR, 1.10 [95\% CI, 1.00-1.21]). Secondary analyses yielded similar results. Conclusions and Relevance: Low-cost reminder devices did not improve adherence among nonadherent patients who were taking up to 3 medications to treat common chronic conditions. The devices may have been more effective if coupled with interventions to ensure consistent use or if targeted to individuals with an even higher risk of nonadherence.

This study aims to assess the short-term change in depressive and anxiety symptoms in relation to COVID-19 vaccination among Swedish adults. Methods A prospective study of 7,925 individuals recruited from ongoing cohort studies at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, or through social media campaigns, with monthly data collections on self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021. Prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms (defined as a self-reported total score of {$\geq$}10 in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively) was calculated one month before, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or choosing not to report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability. Results 5,079 (64.1\%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9\%) received one dose, 305 (3.9\%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1\%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated individuals, especially after the second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was lower after both first (aRR = 0.82, 95\%CI 0.76\textendash 0.88 for depression; aRR = 0.81, 95\%CI 0.73\textendash 0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR = 0.79, 95\%CI 0.73\textendash 0.85 for depression; aRR = 0.73, 95\%CI 0.66\textendash 0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared to before vaccination. Similar results were observed among individuals receiving only one dose (aRR = 0.76, 95\%CI 0.68\textendash 0.84 for depression; aRR = 0.82, 95\%CI 0.72\textendash 0.94 for anxiety), comparing after first dose to before vaccination. Conclusions We observed a short-term improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms among adults receiving COVID-19 vaccines in the current pandemic. Our findings provide new evidence to support outreach campaigns targeting hesitant groups.},

The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects, as well as on vulnerable societies, are a concern for the entire scientific community. Rising temperatures, heat waves, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fires, loss of forest, and glaciers, along with disappearance of rivers and desertification, can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental. However, there is a clear lack in psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change.MethodsLiterature available on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library until end of June 2019 were reviewed. The total number of articles and association reports was 445. From these, 163 were selected. We looked for the association between classical psychiatric disorders such as anxiety schizophrenia, mood disorder and depression, suicide, aggressive behaviors, despair for the loss of usual landscape, and phenomena related to climate change and extreme weather. Review of literature was then divided into specific areas: the course of change in mental health, temperature, water, air pollution, drought, as well as the exposure of certain groups and critical psychological adaptations.ResultsClimate change has an impact on a large part of the population, in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health. However, the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect. Lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue. It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing. The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly\textemdash some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions. Moreover, climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions, as well as a lack of access to resources, information, and protection. Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms, coined only recently: ecoanxiety, ecoguilt, ecopsychology, ecological grief, solastalgia, biospheric concern, etc.ConclusionsThe effects of climate change can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term. Acute events can act through mechanisms similar to that of traumatic stress, leading to well-understood psychopathological patterns. In addition, the consequences of exposure to extreme or prolonged weather-related events can also be delayed, encompassing disorders such as posttraumatic stress, or even transmitted to later generations.},

We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults ({$\geq$}18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20\% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause).

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mortality rates are used as global measures of a population's health status and as indicators for public health efforts and medical treatments. Elevated mortality rates among individuals with mental illness have been reported in various studies, but very little focus has been placed on interstate comparisons and congruency of mortality and causes of death among public mental health clients. METHODS: Using age-adjusted death rates, standardized mortality ratios, and years of potential life lost, we compared the mortality of public mental health clients in eight states with the mortality of their state general populations. The data used in our study were submitted by public mental health agencies in eight states (Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia) for 1997 through 2000 during the Sixteen-State Study on Mental Health Performance Measures, a multistate study federally funded by the Center for Mental Health Services in collaboration with the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. RESULTS: In all eight states, we found that public mental health clients had a higher relative risk of death than the general populations of their states. Deceased public mental health clients had died at much younger ages and lost decades of potential life when compared with their living cohorts nationwide. Clients with major mental illness diagnoses died at younger ages and lost more years of life than people with non-major mental illness diagnoses. Most mental health clients died of natural causes similar to the leading causes of death found nationwide, including heart disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular, respiratory, and lung diseases. CONCLUSION: Mental health and physical health are intertwined; both types of care should be provided and linked together within health care delivery systems. Research to track mortality and primary care should be increased to provide information for additional action, treatment modification, diagnosis-specific risk, and evidence-based practices.},

Researchers using subjective well-being data should be aware of the potential biasing effects of the weather on their estimates. In this paper, the responsiveness of well-being to climate and transitory weather conditions is investigated by analyzing subjective well-being data collected in the Princeton Affect and Time Survey. General satisfaction questions about life in general, life at home, health and one's job, as well as questions concerning feelings intensities during specific episodes are studied. Women are much more responsive than men to the weather, and life satisfaction decreases with the amount of rain on the day of the interview. Low temperatures increase happiness and reduce tiredness and stress, raising net affect, and high temperatures reduce happiness, consistent with the fact that the survey was conducted in the summer. Methods to reduce the possible biases are suggested in the conclusion.},

AIMS: To examine neuroimaging evidence for the distinction between neurological and psychiatric disorders. METHOD: We performed an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on voxel-based morphometry studies reporting decreased grey matter in 14 neurological and 10 psychiatric disorders, and compared the regional and network-level alterations for these two classes of disease. In addition, we estimated neuroanatomical heterogeneity within and between the two classes. RESULTS: Basal ganglia, insula, sensorimotor and temporal cortex showed greater impairment in neurological disorders; whereas cingulate, medial frontal, superior frontal and occipital cortex showed greater impairment in psychiatric disorders. The two classes of disorders affected distinct functional networks. Similarity within classes was higher than between classes; furthermore, similarity within class was higher for neurological than psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: From a neuroimaging perspective, neurological and psychiatric disorders represent two distinct classes of disorders.},

We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 46,581 U.S. participants with commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance from Humana. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Participants in the usual care condition only received standard mailings that the insurer usually sends. In addition to the standard mailings, participants in the other three conditions also received (1) mailings that reminded them to take a target medication (basic reminder condition), (2) reminders that prompted them to predict their medication adherence in the next 30days (prediction condition), or (3) reminders that prompted them to commit to a self-determined level of adherence for the next 30days (commitment condition). We sent these mailings once a month for three months from November, 2014 through January, 2015, and tracked prescription refills. We find that, during the mailing period, reminders increased adherence by 0.95 percentage points (p{$<$}0.05), and this effect was driven by the prediction and commitment conditions; during the three-month post-mailing period, reminders increased adherence by 0.98 percentage points (p{$<$}0.05), and this effect was driven by the basic reminder and commitment conditions. The reminders increased medication adherence by 0.7 pills per dollar spent over our 181day study period. Trial registry name: Effect of Reminders on Adherence.

In this analysis, we examine the relationship between the direction and magnitude of confounding in the source data and resulting bias in the attributable fraction when incorrect methods are used. We assess confounding by the confounding risk ratio, which is the ratio of the crude RR to the adjusted RR. We assess bias in the AF by the ratio of the incorrectly calculated AF to the correctly calculated AF. Using generated data, we examine the relationship between confounding and AF bias under various scenarios of population prevalence of exposure and strength of the exposure-disease association.

Between 33.1\% (Colombia) and 80.9\% (Nigeria) of 12-month cases were mild (IQR, 40.2\%-53.3\%). Serious disorders were associated with substantial role disability. Although disorder severity was correlated with probability of treatment in almost all countries, 35.5\%.to 50.3\% of serious cases in developed countries and 76.3\% to 85.4\% in less-developed countries received no treatment in the 12 months before the interview. Due to the high prevalence of mild and subthreshold cases, the number of those who received treatment far exceeds the number of untreated serious cases in every country.Conclusions Reallocation of treatment resources could substantially decrease the problem of unmet need for treatment of mental disorders among serious cases. Structural barriers exist to this reallocation. Careful consideration needs to be given to the value of treating some mild cases,. especially those at risk for progressing to more serious disorders.},

We conducted meta-analyses of prevalence rates using a random-effects model, and the heterogeneity of studies was examined using the I2 index. Results Fourteen studies involving 46,158 participants were included in the review. The studies use clinical cut-off scores on anxiety and depression measures to define cases. While the prevalence of anxiety was 31.00\% (95\% CI = 26.00 to 35.00), the prevalence of depression was 32.00\% (95\% CI = 29.00 to 35.00). The prevalence of anxiety pre-pandemic was 4.65\%, indicating a 26.35\% increase. Whereas the prevalence of depression pre-pandemic was 4.12\%, indicating a 27.88\% increase. Moreover, participants experienced a slightly greater prevalence of depression than anxiety by 1.00\%. Conclusions To conclude, the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom increased the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population, compared to pre-pandemic data. Hence, it is vital that policymakers and mental health services maximize their efforts to monitor mental health and provide interventions to support those in need. Practitioner points Clinical implications Awareness of the high prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first lockdown in the United Kingdom can inform policy development that substantial effort, time, and funding of mental health services are required to support those in need. Similarly, awareness of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the United Kingdom can contribute to the development of nation-specific interventions and initiatives. Limitations The current review focuses on the UK general population which does not allow the findings to be generalized to the global population. The indirect comparison of the current prevalence rates with the corresponding pre-pandemic prevalence rates obtained from a different study sample increases individual differences, weakening the reliability of the findings.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The incidence of diarrhea, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income countries such as Nepal, is temperature-sensitive, suggesting it could be associated with climate change. With climate change fueled increases in the mean and variability of temperature and precipitation, the incidence of water and food-borne diseases are increasing, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This national-level ecological study was undertaken to provide evidence linking weather and climate with diarrhea incidence in Nepal. Method: We analyzed monthly diarrheal disease count and meteorological data from all districts, spanning 15 eco-development regions of Nepal. Meteorological data and monthly data on diarrheal disease were sourced, respectively, from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology and Health Management Information System (HMIS) of the Government of Nepal for the period from 2002 to 2014. Time-series log-linear regression models assessed the relationship between maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and diarrhea burden. Predictors with p-values {$<$} 0.25 were retained in the fitted models. Results: Overall, diarrheal disease incidence in Nepal significantly increased with 1 {$\smwhtcircle$}C increase in mean temperature (4.4\%; 95\% CI: 3.95, 4.85) and 1 cm increase in rainfall (0.28\%; 95\% CI: 0.15, 0.41). Seasonal variation of diarrheal incidence was prominent at the national level (11.63\% rise in diarrheal cases in summer (95\% CI: 4.17, 19.61) and 14.5\% decrease in spring (95\% CI: -18.81, -10.02) compared to winter season). Moreover, the effects of temperature and rainfall were highest in the mountain region compared to other ecological regions of Nepal. Conclusion: Our study provides empirical evidence linking weather factors and diarrheal disease burden in Nepal. This evidence suggests that additional climate change could increase diarrheal disease incidence across the nation. Mountainous regions are more sensitive to climate variability and consequently the burden of diarrheal diseases. These findings can be utilized to allocate necessary resources and envision a weather-based early warning system for the prevention and control of diarrheal diseases in Nepal.},

In order to investigate the relationship among heat, humidity and mental health, we matched data from the Social, Economic and Environmental Factors (SEEF) project with gridded daily temperature and water vapour pressure data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Logit models were employed to describe the associations among heat (assessed using temperature, \textdegree C), humidity (assessed using vapour pressure, hPa) and two measures of mental health, (i) high or very high distress (assessed using K10 scores {$\geq$} 22) and (ii) having been treated for depression or anxiety. We found a one-unit increase in temperature and vapour pressure was associated with an increase in the occurrence of high or very high distress by 0.2\% (p {$<$} 0.001, 99\% CI: 0.1\textendash 0.3\%) and 0.1\% (p {$<$} 0.001, 99\% CI: 0.0\textendash 0.3\%) respectively. However, when humidity rose to the 99th percentile of the sample, the estimated marginal effect of heat was more than doubled (0.5\%, p {$<$} 0.001, 99\% CI: 0.2\textendash 0.7\%). Neither heat nor humidity was related to having been treated for depression or anxiety in the last month. Humidity compounds the negative association between hot weather and mental health and thus should be taken into account when reforming the health care system to respond to the challenge of climate change.},

During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020.The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it.Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, {$\geq$}20).A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3\%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during\textendash COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0\%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2\%] men; 933 [64.7\%] non-Hispanic White). The pre\textendash COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8\%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4\%] women; 1790 [62.9\%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6\% [95\% CI, 21.8\%-27.7\%] vs 16.2\% [95\% CI, 15.1\%-17.4\%]; moderate: 14.8\% [95\% CI, 12.6\%-17.4\%] vs 5.7\% [95\% CI, 4.8\%-6.9\%]; moderately severe: 7.9\% [95\% CI, 6.3\%-9.8\%] vs 2.1\% [95\% CI, 1.6\%-2.8\%]; severe: 5.1\% [95\% CI, 3.8\%-6.9\%] vs 0.7\% [95\% CI, 0.5\%-0.9\%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95\% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than \$5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95\% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95\% CI, 1.95-4.77]).These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms. Post\textendash COVID-19 plans should account for the probable increase in mental illness to come, particularly among at-risk populations.},

  abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) identified mental and substance use disorders as the 5th leading contributor of burden in 2010, measured by disability adjusted life years (DALYs). This estimate was incomplete as it excluded burden resulting from the increased risk of suicide captured elsewhere in GBD 2010's mutually exclusive list of diseases and injuries. Here, we estimate suicide DALYs attributable to mental and substance use disorders. Methods Relative-risk estimates of suicide due to mental and substance use disorders and the global prevalence of each disorder were used to estimate population attributable fractions. These were adjusted for global differences in the proportion of suicide due to mental and substance use disorders compared to other causes then multiplied by suicide DALYs reported in GBD 2010 to estimate attributable DALYs (with 95\% uncertainty). Results Mental and substance use disorders were responsible for 22.5 million (14.8\textendash 29.8 million) of the 36.2 million (26.5\textendash 44.3 million) DALYs allocated to suicide in 2010. Depression was responsible for the largest proportion of suicide DALYs (46.1\% (28.0\%\textendash 60.8\%)) and anorexia nervosa the lowest (0.2\% (0.02\%\textendash 0.5\%)). DALYs occurred throughout the lifespan, with the largest proportion found in Eastern Europe and Asia, and males aged 20\textendash 30 years. The inclusion of attributable suicide DALYs would have increased the overall burden of mental and substance use disorders (assigned to them in GBD 2010 as a direct cause) from 7.4\% (6.2\%\textendash 8.6\%) to 8.3\% (7.1\%\textendash 9.6\%) of global DALYs, and would have changed the global ranking from 5th to 3rd leading cause of burden. Conclusions Capturing the suicide burden attributable to mental and substance use disorders allows for more accurate estimates of burden. More consideration needs to be given to interventions targeted to populations with, or at risk for, mental and substance use disorders as an effective strategy for suicide prevention.},

Here we present the modelled epidemiological profile of MDD dealing with heterogeneity in the data, enforcing internal consistency between epidemiological parameters and making estimates for world regions with no empirical data. These estimates were used to quantify the burden of MDD for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010). Method Analyses drew on data from our existing literature review of the epidemiology of MDD. DisMod-MR, the latest version of the generic disease modelling system redesigned as a Bayesian meta-regression tool, derived prevalence by age, year and sex for 21 regions. Prior epidemiological knowledge, study- and country-level covariates adjusted sub-optimal raw data. Results There were over 298 million cases of MDD globally at any point in time in 2010, with the highest proportion of cases occurring between 25 and 34 years. Global point prevalence was very similar across time (4.4\% (95\% uncertainty: 4.2\textendash 4.7\%) in 1990, 4.4\% (4.1\textendash 4.7\%) in 2005 and 2010), but higher in females (5.5\% (5.0\textendash 6.0\%) compared to males (3.2\% (3.0\textendash 3.6\%) in 2010. Regions in conflict had higher prevalence than those with no conflict. The annual incidence of an episode of MDD followed a similar age and regional pattern to prevalence but was about one and a half times higher, consistent with an average duration of 37.7 weeks. Conclusion We were able to integrate available data, including those from high quality surveys and sub-optimal studies, into a model adjusting for known methodological sources of heterogeneity. We were also able to estimate the epidemiology of MDD in regions with no available data. This informed GBD 2010 and the public health field, with a clearer understanding of the global distribution of MDD.},

Little is known about this relationship in South American countries located in regions of a hot climate. This study aims to investigate the effects of ambient temperature on mortality due to AMI in six Brazilian micro-regions, which present different climates. We analyzed daily records of deaths by AMI between 1996 and 2013. We estimated the accumulate relative and attributable risks with lags of up to 14 days, using distributed non-linear lag model. Micro-regions that were closest to the equator did not show an association between temperature and mortality. The lowest risk temperatures varied between 22\,\textdegree C and 28\,\textdegree C, in the Southern region of Brazil and the Midwest region, respectively. Low temperatures associated with the highest mortality risk were observed in the same areas, varying between 5\,\textdegree C and 15\,\textdegree C. The number of deaths attributed to cold temperatures varied from 176/year in Brasilia to 661/year in S\~ao Paulo and those deaths attributed to hot temperatures in Rio de Janeiro amounted to 115/year. We showed the relative risk and the attributable risk of warmer and colder days in tropical regions. The estimate of the number of deaths due to climate, varying according to each area, is a way of bringing information to those responsible for health policies based on easily-understood measurements.},

  abstract = {Objective COVID-19 is rearranging our society with fear and worry about the novel coronavirus impacting the mental health of Americans. The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Methods Using an online platform, a national sample (n = 10, 368) of U.S. adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020. The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U.S. population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography. Results Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country; rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found. Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities. Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts. Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology; prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States. Conclusions This preliminary work provides practitioners with a glimpse of what lies ahead, which individuals and communities may be the most vulnerable, and what types of strategic interventions might help to address a wide range of mental health consequences for Americans in the months and years ahead.},

We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged{$\geq$}18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3\% (95\%CI: 46.9\%-49.7\%), 22.6\% (95\%CI: 21.4\%-23.8\%) and 19.4\% (95\%CI: 18.3\%-20.6\%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80\% (95\%CI:80.9\%-83.1\%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95\%CI: 1.31\textendash 2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95\%CI: 1.52\textendash 2.41) compared with less SME. Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with ``infodemic'' while combating during public health emergency.},

This study investigated depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand (NZ) during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated psychological and behavioural factors. It also compares the results with a similar cross-sectional study in the UK. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting NZ community cohort. Participants N=681 adults ({$\geq$}18 years) in NZ. The cohort was predominantly female (89\%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18\textendash 87). Most (74\%) identified as NZ European and almost half (46\%) were keyworkers. Most were non-smokers (95\%) and 20\% identified themselves as having clinical risk factors which would put them at increased or greatest risk of COVID-19. Main outcome measures Depression, anxiety, stress, positive mood and engagement in health behaviours (smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption). Results Depression and anxiety significantly exceeded population norms (p{$<$}0.0001). Being younger (p{$<$}0.0001) and most at risk of COVID-19 (p{$<$}0.05) were associated with greater depression, anxiety and stress. Greater positive mood, lower loneliness and greater exercise were protective factors for all outcomes (p{$<$}0.0001). Smoking (p=0.037) and alcohol consumption (p{$<$}0.05) were associated with increased anxiety. Pet ownership was associated with lower depression (p=0.006) and anxiety (p=0.008). When adjusting for age and gender differences, anxiety (p=0.002) and stress (p=0.007) were significantly lower in NZ than in the UK. The NZ sample reported lower perceived risk (p{$<$}0.0001) and worry about COVID-19 (p{$<$}0.0001) than the UK sample. Conclusions The NZ population had higher depression and anxiety compared with population norms. Younger people and those most at risk of COVID-19 reported poorer mental health. Interventions should promote frequent exercise, and reduce loneliness and unhealthy behaviours.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mental disorders included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 were depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, conduct disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, idiopathic developmental intellectual disability, and a residual category of other mental disorders. We aimed to measure the global, regional, and national prevalence, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYS), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) for mental disorders from 1990 to 2019. METHODS: In this study, we assessed prevalence and burden estimates from GBD 2019 for 12 mental disorders, males and females, 23 age groups, 204 countries and territories, between 1990 and 2019. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs to premature mortality. We systematically reviewed PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and the Global Health Data Exchange to obtain data on prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, severity, and excess mortality for each mental disorder. These data informed a Bayesian meta-regression analysis to estimate prevalence by disorder, age, sex, year, and location. Prevalence was multiplied by corresponding disability weights to estimate YLDs. Cause-specific deaths were compiled from mortality surveillance databases. The Cause of Death Ensemble modelling strategy was used to estimate death rate by age, sex, year, and location. The death rates were multiplied by the years of life expected to be remaining at death based on a normative life expectancy to estimate YLLs. Deaths and YLLs could be calculated only for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, since these were the only mental disorders identified as underlying causes of death in GBD 2019. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2019, the global number of DALYs due to mental disorders increased from 80{$\cdot$}8 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 59{$\cdot$}5-105{$\cdot$}9) to 125{$\cdot$}3 million (93{$\cdot$}0-163{$\cdot$}2), and the proportion of global DALYs attributed to mental disorders increased from 3{$\cdot$}1\% (95\% UI 2{$\cdot$}4-3{$\cdot$}9) to 4{$\cdot$}9\% (3{$\cdot$}9-6{$\cdot$}1). Age-standardised DALY rates remained largely consistent between 1990 (1581{$\cdot$}2 DALYs [1170{$\cdot$}9-2061{$\cdot$}4] per 100\,000 people) and 2019 (1566{$\cdot$}2 DALYs [1160{$\cdot$}1-2042{$\cdot$}8] per 100\,000 people). YLDs contributed to most of the mental disorder burden, with 125{$\cdot$}3 million YLDs (95\% UI 93{$\cdot$}0-163{$\cdot$}2; 14{$\cdot$}6\% [12{$\cdot$}2-16{$\cdot$}8] of global YLDs) in 2019 attributable to mental disorders. Eating disorders accounted for 17\,361{$\cdot$}5 YLLs (95\% UI 15\,518{$\cdot$}5-21\,459{$\cdot$}8). Globally, the age-standardised DALY rate for mental disorders was 1426{$\cdot$}5 (95\% UI 1056{$\cdot$}4-1869{$\cdot$}5) per 100\,000 population among males and 1703{$\cdot$}3 (1261{$\cdot$}5-2237{$\cdot$}8) per 100\,000 population among females. Age-standardised DALY rates were highest in Australasia, Tropical Latin America, and high-income North America. INTERPRETATION: GBD 2019 showed that mental disorders remained among the top ten leading causes of burden worldwide, with no evidence of global reduction in the burden since 1990. The estimated YLLs for mental disorders were extremely low and do not reflect premature mortality in individuals with mental disorders. Research to establish causal pathways between mental disorders and other fatal health outcomes is recommended so that this may be addressed within the GBD study. To reduce the burden of mental disorders, coordinated delivery of effective prevention and treatment programmes by governments and the global health community is imperative.

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7\% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6\% anxiety and 15.8\% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.},

What is needed is a clear understanding of these pathways to build resilience, taking into account robust projections of the country's climate and development future. This report highlights the most prominent climate change impacts facing Madagascar, with a particular emphasis on health, and provides investment relevant solutions to build resilience. Through the establishment of priority interventions to address the identified vulnerabilities, this report links evidence to opportunities for development actors, while providing specific input into the design of a World Bank investment. In doing so, the report builds momentum for the emerging climate and health activities in the country and seeks to facilitate multi-sector dialogue to enhance Madagascar's policy planning.},

In this study, we quantified excess mortality associated with mental disorders in HIV-positive people in South Africa, adjusting for HIV treatment outcomes.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}For this cohort study, we analysed routinely collected data on HIV-positive adults receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cape Town, South Africa between Jan 1, 2004, to Dec 31, 2017. Data from three ART programmes were linked with routine medical records on mental health treatment from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2017, and mortality surveillance data from the South African National Population Register up to Dec 31, 2017. People living with HIV aged 15 years or older who initiated ART at a programme site were eligible for analysis. We followed up patients from ART initiation or Jan 1, 2010, whichever occurred later, to transfer, death, or Dec 31, 2017. Patients were considered as having a history of mental illness if they had ever received psychiatric medication or been hospitalised for a mental disorder. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95\% CIs for associations between history of mental illness, mortality, and HIV treatment outcomes (retention in care with viral load suppression [VLS; viral load {$<$}1000 copies per mL], retention in care with non-suppressed viral load [NVL; viral load {$\geq$}1000 copies per mL], and loss to follow-up [LTFU; {$>$}180 days late for a clinic visit at closure of the database]) using Cox proportional hazard regression and multistate models.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}58 664 patients were followed up for a median of 4{$\cdot$}3 years (IQR 2{$\cdot$}1\textendash 6{$\cdot$}4), 2927 (5{$\cdot$}0\%) of whom had a history of mental illness. After adjustment for age, sex, treatment programme, and year of ART initiation, history of mental illness was associated with increased risk of mortality from all causes (aHR 2{$\cdot$}98 [95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}69\textendash 3{$\cdot$}30]), natural causes (3{$\cdot$}00 [2{$\cdot$}69\textendash 3{$\cdot$}36]), and unnatural causes (2{$\cdot$}10 [1{$\cdot$}27\textendash 3{$\cdot$}49]), compared with no history of mental illness. Risk of all-cause mortality in people with a history of mental illness remained increased in multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, treatment programme, year of ART initiation, CD4 count and WHO clinical stage at ART initiation, retention in HIV care with or without VLS, and LTFU (2{$\cdot$}73 [2{$\cdot$}46\textendash 3{$\cdot$}02]). In our multistate model, adjusted for age, sex, year of ART initiation, cumulative time with NVL, and WHO clinical stage and CD4 cell count at ART initiation, rates of excess all-cause mortality in people with history of mental illness were greatest in patients retained in care with VLS (aHR 3{$\cdot$}43 [95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}83\textendash 4{$\cdot$}15]), followed by patients retained in care with NVL (2{$\cdot$}74 [2{$\cdot$}32\textendash 3{$\cdot$}24]), and smallest in those LTFU (2{$\cdot$}12 [1{$\cdot$}78\textendash 2{$\cdot$}53]). History of mental illness was also associated with increased risk of HIV viral rebound (transitioning from VLS to NVL; 1{$\cdot$}50 [1{$\cdot$}32\textendash 1{$\cdot$}69]) and LTFU in people with VLS (1{$\cdot$}19 [1{$\cdot$}06\textendash 1{$\cdot$}34]).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Mental illness was associated with substantial excess mortality in HIV-positive adults in Cape Town.

Methods Longitudinal data (wave 4 in November 2020: n~=~7,115; wave 5 in January 2021: n~=~7,068; wave 6 in April 2021: n~=~7,204) were taken from the European COvid Survey (ECOS), a representative sample of non-institutionalized inhabitants from Germany, United Kingdom, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Portugal and Italy aged 18+. Probable depression and anxiety were quantified using the established and validated PHQ-4 (2-item depression scale, PHQ-2 / 2-item anxiety scale, GAD-2). Results In wave 4 (wave 5; wave 6), 26.6\% (25.5\%; 23.8\%) of all respondents had probable depression and 25.7\% (23.6\%; 22.1\%) had probable anxiety. Prevalence rates for probable depression and probable anxiety differed significantly between countries. Among all countries and waves, particularly high prevalence rates were found among individuals aged 18 to 29 years. Longitudinal analysis showed that the likelihood of probable depression was positively associated with increasing age, great income difficulties and lower health-related quality of life. The likelihood of probable anxiety was positively associated with income difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life. Limitations Screening tool was used to quantify the outcomes. Conclusion The magnitude of probable depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in European countries was highlighted. Moreover, determining the factors associated with probable depression or anxiety (e.g., income difficulties, worse health-related quality of life) may assist in identifying individuals at increased risk.},

The rapid spread of the disease created challenges for healthcare systems and forced healthcare workers to grapple with clinical and nonclinical stressors, including shortages of personal protective equipment, mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19, fear of bringing the virus home to family members, and the reality of losing colleagues to the disease. Evidence from previous outbreaks, along with early evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that these events have significant short- and long-term effects on the mental health of healthcare workers. All healthcare stakeholders should create short- and long-term plans to support the mental health of workers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

We aimed to identify principal meteorological factors associated with pneumonia, and to estimate the effect size and lag time. Methods This was nationwide population-based study used a healthcare claims database merged with a weather database in eight metropolitan cities in Korea. We applied a stepwise approach using the Granger causality test and generalized additive model to elucidate the association between weekly pneumonia incidence (WPI) and meteorological factors/air pollutants (MFAP). Impulse response function was used to examine the time lag. Results In total, 2~011~424 cases of pneumonia were identified from 2007 to 2017. Among MFAP, diurnal temperature range (DTR), humidity and particulate matter {$\leq$}2.5 {$\mu$}m in diameter (PM2.5) showed statistically significant associations with WPI (p~{$<~$}0.001 for all 3 MFAPs). The association of DTR and WPI showed an inverted U pattern for bacterial and unspecified pneumonia, whereas for viral pneumonia, WPI increased gradually in a more linear manner with DTR and no substantial decline. Humidity showed a consistent pattern in all three pneumonia categories. WPI steeply increased up to 10 to 20 {$\mu$}g/m{$^3$} of PM2.5 but did not show a further increase in higher concentrations. On the basis of the result, we examined the effect of MFAP in different lag times up to 3~weeks. Conclusions DTR, humidity and PM2.5 were identified as MFAP most closely associated with WPI. With the model, we were able to visualize the effect\textendash time association of MFAP and WPI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental illness is a major group of disorder that can lead to both physical and emotional disability. Policymakers need to learn not only the epidemiological indicators of mental illness, such as prevalence rate and incidence rate, but also the size of its negative impact on the economy. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study is to review international publications on cost of major mental illness literature, from 1990 to 2003, focusing on the concepts, methods, and future perspective of cost illness studies. Reviewing the status quo on costs of mental illness can provide further information about gaps, limitations, and future needs on this topic. METHOD: This review searched all major international journals in psychiatry, clinical psychology, health economics, and mental health policy published since 1990. All national or aggregate cost of mental illness studies were included in the review. All were individually reviewed using a conceptual framework of cost of illness methodology. RESULTS: A large majority of published cost of mental illness studies were conducted in the US and UK. Cost of illness studies were lacking from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Empirical results from the reviewed studies indicate that the negative economic consequences of mental illness far exceed the direct costs of treatment, thus making it important to treat mental illness. Direct treatment costs for each mental disorder (i.e. depression, schizophrenia, dementia, etc.) is between 1\% and 2\% of total national health care costs. DISCUSSION: The studies reviewed indicate great variation in cost estimates even for the same mental disorder during the same time period within a country. These wide variations may be due to differences in disorder classification, definition of cost categories, sample populations, data sources, and discounting rate. Given the limitations of the cost of illness studies reviewed, one should be careful in interpreting and using these estimated results. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH SERVICES: These cost studies can be useful for understanding the magnitude of treating an illness of economic consequences or economic consequences of an illness for purposes of planning or budgeting. Such studies are one way to inform policymakers about economic consequences of mental illness.},

This study represents the first assessment of rates of anxiety and depression in the general population of Ireland during the pandemic. Aims Our first aim was to estimate the probable prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression and to identify sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for GAD or depression. Our second aim was to determine if COVID-19 related anxiety was highest amongst those in society at greatest risk of morality from COVID-19. Method Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1041) online between March 31 and April 5; the first week of the nationwide quarantine measures. Recognized cut-off scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used to estimate rates of GAD and depression. Correlates of screening positive for GAD or depression were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Results GAD (20.0\%), depression (22.8\%) and GAD or depression (27.7\%) was common. Screening positive for GAD or depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 related anxiety than adults aged 18\textendash 34. Conclusions Initial results from this multi-wave study monitoring changes in population anxiety and depression throughout the pandemic indicate that GAD and depression were common experiences in the population during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Idioms of distress communicate suffering via reference to shared ethnopsychologies, and better understanding of idioms of distress can contribute to effective clinical and public health communication. This systematic review is a qualitative synthesis of ``thinking too much'' idioms globally, to determine their applicability and variability across cultures. We searched eight databases and retained publications if they included empirical quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods research regarding a ``thinking too much'' idiom and were in English. In total, 138 publications from 1979 to 2014 met inclusion criteria. We examined the descriptive epidemiology, phenomenology, etiology, and course of ``thinking too much'' idioms and compared them to psychiatric constructs. ``Thinking too much'' idioms typically reference ruminative, intrusive, and anxious thoughts and result in a range of perceived complications, physical and mental illnesses, or even death. These idioms appear to have variable overlap with common psychiatric constructs, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. However, ``thinking too much'' idioms reflect aspects of experience, distress, and social positioning not captured by psychiatric diagnoses and often show wide within-cultural variation, in addition to between-cultural differences. Taken together, these findings suggest that ``thinking too much'' should not be interpreted as a gloss for psychiatric disorder nor assumed to be a unitary symptom or syndrome within a culture. We suggest five key ways in which engagement with ``thinking too much'' idioms can improve global mental health research and interventions: it (1) incorporates a key idiom of distress into measurement and screening to improve validity of efforts at identifying those in need of services and tracking treatment outcomes; (2) facilitates exploration of ethnopsychology in order to bolster cultural appropriateness of interventions; (3) strengthens public health communication to encourage engagement in treatment; (4) reduces stigma by enhancing understanding, promoting treatment-seeking, and avoiding unintentionally contributing to stigmatization; and (5) identifies a key locally salient treatment target.},

  abstract = {Background: We develop a framework for quantifying monetary values associated with changes in disease-specific mortality risk in low- and middle-income countries to help quantify trade-offs involved in investing in mortality reduction due to one disease versus another. Methods: We monetized the changes in mortality risk for communicable and non-communicable diseases (CD and NCD, respectively) between 2017 and 2030 for low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income countries (LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively). We modeled three mortality trajectories (``base-case'', ``highperformance'', and ``low-performance'') using Global Burden of Disease study forecasts and estimated diseasespecific mortality risk changes relative to the base-case. We assigned monetary values to changes in mortality risk using value of a statistical life (VSL) methods and conducted multiple sensitivity analyses. Results: In terms of NCDs, the absolute monetary value associated with changing mortality risk was highest for cardiovascular diseases in older age groups. For example, being on the low-performance trajectory relative to the base-case in 2030 was valued at \$9100 (95\% uncertainty range \$6800; \$11,400), \$28,300 (\$24,200; \$32,400), and \$30, 300 (\$27,200; \$33,300) for females aged 70\textendash 74 years in LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. Changing the mortality rate from the base-case to the high-performance trajectory was associated with high monetary value for CDs as well, especially among younger age groups. Estimates were sensitive to assumptions made in calculating VSL. Conclusions: Our framework provides a priority setting paradigm to best allocate investments toward the health sector and enables intersectoral comparisons of returns on investments from health interventions.},

In the arena of global health, the United States can create a new role for itself by moving beyond a national-interest paradigm and strengthening its "soft power" position in health. Health in recent administrations has moved beyond being "just" a humanitarian issue to being one with major economic and security interests. Despite U.S. unilateralism, new approaches to global health governance are being developed by other actors, who have influenced the U.S. agenda and made important contributions. Yet a larger leader is still needed, especially in identifying and following a sound legal and regulatory global health governance system; bringing political legitimacy; and setting priorities. Responsible political action is needed to develop a new mindset and lay the groundwork for better global health in the future.}

This paper examines the prevalence and risk factors of depression in childhood and adolescence as seen in a community sample derived from four disadvantaged districts in north-eastern Uganda. Methods 1587 children were assessed using a structured instrument administered by trained psychiatric nurses to collect data on psychiatric disorders (DSM IV criteria), adverse psychosocial factors and socio-demographic factors. Results The point prevalence of depressive disorder syndromes (DDS) in this study was 8.6\% (95\% CI 7.2\%\textendash 10.1\%) with a point prevalence for major depressive episode of 7.6\% (95\% CI 6.3\%\textendash 9.0\%) and dysthymia of 2.1\% (95\% CI 1.5\%\textendash 3.0\%). At multiple logistic regression, the factors that were independently significantly associated with DDS were: district (representing ecological factors), nature of living arrangements, domestic violence and psychiatric co-morbidities/psychiatric problems of emotional distress (assessed by the SDQ), suicidality and marginally, anxiety disorder syndromes, eating disorder syndromes, motor disorder syndromes and behavioral and developmental disorder syndromes (the later being protective against depression). Conclusion Disadvantaged north-eastern Uganda had a high prevalence of childhood depressive disorders. Ecological factors, markers of the quality of the child-principal caregiver relationship (nature of living arrangements and domestic violence) and the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities/psychiatric problems were the important independent determinants of childhood depression in this study.},

Design Rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. Results 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95\% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity. Conclusions Effective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak. These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.},

Articles reviewed show that disaster psychiatry in Asia is beginning to emerge from and leave behind the stigma attached to mental health. The emergence of the acceptance of disaster mental health throughout Asia can be attributed in part to the acceptance of the notion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This has allowed greater involvement of mental health professionals in providing ongoing support to survivors of natural disasters as well as providing greater opportunities for further research. Also, articles reviewed in the present paper commonly suggested the need for using standardized diagnostic tools for PTSD to appropriately interpret the discrepancy of results among studies. The importance of post-disaster support services and cultural differences is highlighted.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the edit distance of a regular language (the set of words accepted by a given finite automaton). This quantity is the smallest edit distance between any pair of distinct words of the language. We show that the problem is of polynomial time complexity. In particular, for a given finite automaton A with n transitions, over an alphabet of r symbols, our algorithm operates in time O(n2r2q2(q+r)), where q is either the diameter of A (if A is deterministic), or the square of the number of states in A (if A is nondeterministic). Incidentally, we also obtain an upper bound on the edit distance of a regular language in terms of the automaton accepting the language.},

We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods Emerging adults (N = 450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 287 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results Results supported the validity/reliability of PSQ total scores and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between ambient temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and the development of herpes zoster in Taiwan. An ecological study was conducted to analyse the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Programme. Participants aged {$\geq$}20 years with newly diagnosed herpes zoster between 2003 and 2012 were selected for analysis. The monthly incidence rate of herpes zoster was measured between 2003 and 2012. Monthly average ambient temperature in Celsius (\textdegree C) between 2003 and 2012 was measured according to the official database of the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan. Monthly accumulated ultraviolet radiation (MJ m-2) between 2003 and 2012 was measured according to the official database of the Environmental Protection Administration in Taiwan. The overall incidence rates of herpes zoster ranged from 2.54 to 5.67 per 10 000 persons per month from 2003 to 2012.The monthly average ambient temperature was higher and the monthly accumulated ultraviolet radiation was stronger from May to October. The incidence rates of herpes zoster seemed to be high during the period of high ambient temperature and strong ultraviolet radiation (from May to October).Whenever ambient temperature increased 1\textdegree C per month, the incidence rate of herpes zoster increased by 0.072 per 10,000 persons per month. Whenever ultraviolet radiation increased 1 MJ m-2 per month, the incidence rate of herpes zoster increased by 0.313 per 10 000 persons per month. There is a significant association between ambient temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and the development of herpes zoster in Taiwan. The incidence rate of herpes zoster is high during the period of high ambient temperature and strong ultraviolet radiation. Low ambient temperature and weak ultraviolet radiation might be beneficial for the prevention of herpes zoster.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Task-sharing is a promising strategy to expand mental healthcare in low-resource settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Research on how to best implement task-sharing mental health interventions, however, is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the barriers and facilitators to their implementation. This review aims to systematically identify implementation barriers and facilitators in evidence-based task-sharing mental health interventions using an implementation science lens, organizing factors across a novel, integrated implementation science framework. METHODS: PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Embase were used to identify English-language, peer-reviewed studies using search terms for three categories: "mental health," "task-sharing," and "LMIC." Articles were included if they: focused on mental disorders as the main outcome(s); included a task-sharing intervention using or based on an evidence-based practice; were implemented in an LMIC setting; and included assessment or data-supported analysis of barriers and facilitators. An initial conceptual model and coding framework derived from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Theoretical Domains Framework was developed and iteratively refined to create an integrated conceptual framework, the Barriers and Facilitators in Implementation of Task-Sharing Mental Health Interventions (BeFITS-MH), which specifies 37 constructs across eight domains: (I) client characteristics, (II) provider characteristics, (III) family and community factors, (IV) organizational characteristics, (V) societal factors, (VI) mental health system factors, (VII) intervention characteristics, and (VIII) stigma. RESULTS: Of the 26,935 articles screened (title and abstract), 192 articles underwent full-text review, yielding 37 articles representing 28 unique intervention studies that met the inclusion criteria. The most prevalent facilitators occur in domains that are more amenable to adaptation (i.e., the intervention and provider characteristics domains), while salient barriers occur in domains that are more challenging to modulate or intervene on-these include constructs in the client characteristics as well as the broader societal and structural levels of influence (i.e., the organizational, mental health system domains). Other notable trends include constructs in the family and community domains occurring as barriers and as facilitators roughly equally, and stigma constructs acting exclusively as barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Using the BeFITS-MH model we developed based on implementation science frameworks, this systematic review provides a comprehensive identification and organization of barriers and facilitators to evidence-based task-sharing mental health interventions in LMICs. These findings have important implications for ongoing and future implementation of this critically needed intervention strategy, including the promise of leveraging task-sharing intervention characteristics as sites of continued innovation, the importance of but relative lack of engagement with constructs in macro-level domains (e.g., organizational characteristics, stigma), and the need for more delineation of strategies for task-sharing mental health interventions that researchers and implementers can employ to enhance implementation in and across levels.

Vaccination has been widely considered the best way to prevent COVID-19 pandemic, but public concerns about the safety of vaccines remain. There have been many studies reporting adverse events in the vaccinated. However, to date, no meta-analysis of the association of COVID-19 vaccination with psychiatric adverse events has been conducted yet. In this meta-analysis, studies on depression, anxiety and distress after COVID-19 vaccination were searched in the PubMed, Cochrane and Embase from January 2020 to April 2022. The OR of depression in four studies with a total sample size of 462,406 is obtained as 0.88 (95\% CI; 0.75, 1.03), and the OR of anxiety as 0.86 (95\% CI; 0.71, 1.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. The mean difference of distress in two studies was -0.04 (95\%CI; -0.05, -0.02; p {$<$} 0.0001). As a result of the moderator analysis, married people experienced less depression and anxiety after vaccination, and in White people, depression after vaccination was lower than others. We also found that people with a history of COVID-19 infection were more depressed and anxious after vaccination. We suggest that COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a worsening of depression and anxiety.},

  abstract = {Background At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and spread rapidly to the whole country within 1 month. This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. Material/Methods Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as `affected group' and `unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. Results Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3\% and 14.6\%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9\%, 22.4\%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7\%, 11.9\%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. Conclusions The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population's mental state.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the association of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine with autism spectrum disorder has been convincingly disproven, the onset of certain brain-related autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been found to be temporally associated with the antecedent administration of various vaccines. This study examines whether antecedent vaccinations are associated with increased incidence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa (AN), anxiety disorder, chronic tic disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder in a national sample of privately insured children. METHODS: Using claims data, we compared the prior year's occurrence of vaccinations in children and adolescents aged 6-15\,years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds. Subjects were matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality. Conditional logistic regression models were used to determine the association of prior vaccinations with each condition. RESULTS: Subjects with newly diagnosed AN were more likely than controls to have had any vaccination in the previous 3\,months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95\% confidence interval 1.21-2.68]. Influenza vaccinations during the prior 3, 6, and 12\,months were also associated with incident diagnoses of AN, OCD, and an anxiety disorder. Several other associations were also significant with HRs greater than 1.40 (hepatitis A with OCD and AN; hepatitis B with AN; and meningitis with AN and chronic tic disorder). CONCLUSION: This pilot epidemiologic analysis implies that the onset of some neuropsychiatric disorders may be temporally related to prior vaccinations in a subset of individuals. These findings warrant further investigation, but do not prove a causal role of antecedent infections or vaccinations in the pathoetiology of these conditions. Given the modest magnitude of these findings in contrast to the clear public health benefits of the timely administration of vaccines in preventing mortality and morbidity in childhood infectious diseases, we encourage families to maintain vaccination schedules according to CDC guidelines.},

  abstract = {Background Mental health is an important public health issue globally. A potential link between heat exposure and mental health outcomes has been recognised in the scientific literature; however, the associations between heat exposure (both high ambient temperatures and heatwaves) and mental health-related mortality and morbidity vary between studies and locations. Objective To fill gaps in knowledge, this systematic review aims to summarize the epidemiological evidence and investigate the quantitative effects of high ambient temperatures and heatwaves on mental health-related mortality and morbidity outcomes, while exploring sources of heterogeneity. Methods A systematic search of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies on heat exposure and mental health outcomes published between January 1990 and November 2020 was conducted using five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO). We included studies that examined the association between high ambient temperatures and/or heatwaves and mental health-related mortality and morbidity (e.g. hospital admissions and emergency department visits) in the general population. A range of mental health conditions were defined using ICD-10 classifications. We performed random effects meta-analysis to summarize the relative risks (RRs) in mental health outcomes per 1~\textdegree C increase in temperature, and under different heatwaves definitions. We further evaluated whether variables such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, and climate zone may explain the observed heterogeneity. Results The keyword search yielded 4560 citations from which we identified 53 high temperatures/heatwaves studies that comprised over 1.7 million mental health-related mortality and 1.9 million morbidity cases in total. Our findings suggest associations between heat exposures and a range of mental health-related outcomes. Regarding high temperatures, our meta-analysis of study findings showed that for each 1~\textdegree C increase in temperature, the mental health-related mortality and morbidity increased with a RR of 1.022 (95\%CI: 1.015\textendash 1.029) and 1.009 (95\%CI: 1.007\textendash 1.015), respectively. The greatest mortality risk was attributed to substance-related mental disorders (RR, 1.046; 95\%CI: 0.991\textendash 1.101), followed by organic mental disorders (RR, 1.033; 95\%CI: 1.020\textendash 1.046). A 1~\textdegree C temperature rise was also associated with a significant increase in morbidity such as mood disorders, organic mental disorders, schizophrenia, neurotic and anxiety disorders. Findings suggest evidence of vulnerability for populations living in tropical and subtropical climate zones, and for people aged more than 65~years. There were significant moderate and high heterogeneities between effect estimates in overall mortality and morbidity categories, respectively. Lower heterogeneity was noted in some subgroups. The magnitude of the effect estimates for heatwaves varied depending on definitions used. The highest effect estimates for mental health-related morbidity was observed when heatwaves were defined as ``mean temperature {$\geq$}90th percentile for {$\geq$}3~days'' (RR, 1.753; 95\%CI: 0.567\textendash 5.421), and a significant effect was also observed when the definition was ``mean temperature {$\geq$}95th percentile for {$\geq$}3~days'', with a RR of 1.064 (95\%CI: 1.006\textendash 1.123). Conclusions Our findings support the hypothesis of a positive association between elevated ambient temperatures and/or heatwaves and adverse mental health outcomes. This problem will likely increase with a warming climate, especially in the context of climate change. Further high-quality studies are needed to identify modifying factors of heat impacts.},

Parents of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (N = 20,708) who participated in the 2015-2016 National Survey of Children's Health were surveyed about their children' ACEs (e.g., parental divorce, being a victim of violence, living with anyone who had substance abuse) and current mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. Parents were further asked about their family functioning, perceived social capital, and adolescents' civic engagement. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the hypothesized pathways using Mplus 8.0.Based on parents' report, about 55\% of adolescents have experienced at least one kind of ACE. The final structural model proved an excellent fit to the data (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.009, WRMR = 1.12). A significantly positive relationship was found between adolescents' ACEs and current mental disorders ({$\beta$} = 0.13, p {$<$} 0.05), and the effect was partially mediated by family functioning ({$\beta$} = 0.10, p {$<$} 0.001) and civic engagement ({$\beta$} = 0.01, p {$<$} 0.05), but not by social capital ({$\beta$} = 0.01, p = 0.12). Low household income ({$\beta$} = -0.24, p {$<$} 0.001) and low parent education ({$\beta$} = -0.05, p {$<$} 0.05) significantly increased adolescents' likelihood of having ACEs. Early assessment and interventions for children with ACEs are necessary to prevent the development of mental disorders in adolescence, especially for minority adolescents and those of low socioeconomic status. Safe, nurturing, and supportive home and social environments can help mitigate the detrimental impact of childhood adversity.},

  abstract = {In spite of high levels of poverty in low and middle income countries (LMIC), and the high burden posed by common mental disorders (CMD), it is only in the last two decades that research has emerged that empirically addresses the relationship between poverty and CMD in these countries. We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological literature in LMIC, with the aim of examining this relationship. Of 115 studies that were reviewed, most reported positive associations between a range of poverty indicators and CMD. In community-based studies, 73\% and 79\% of studies reported positive associations between a variety of poverty measures and CMD, 19\% and 15\% reported null associations and 8\% and 6\% reported negative associations, using bivariate and multivariate analyses respectively. However, closer examination of specific poverty dimensions revealed a complex picture, in which there was substantial variation between these dimensions. While variables such as education, food insecurity, housing, social class, socio-economic status and financial stress exhibit a relatively consistent and strong association with CMD, others such as income, employment and particularly consumption are more equivocal. There are several measurement and population factors that may explain variation in the strength of the relationship between poverty and CMD. By presenting a systematic review of the literature, this paper attempts to shift the debate from questions about whether poverty is associated with CMD in LMIC, to questions about which particular dimensions of poverty carry the strongest (or weakest) association. The relatively consistent association between CMD and a variety of poverty dimensions in LMIC serves to strengthen the case for the inclusion of mental health on the agenda of development agencies and in international targets such as the millenium development goals.

Climate is described in terms of `degree-months' calculated as the cumulated monthly deviations from a base temperature of 65\textdegree F (18.3\textdegree C). Our results suggest that countries with climates characterised by a large number of degree-months enjoy significantly lower levels of life satisfaction. This finding is robust to a wide variety of model specifications. Using our results to analyse a particular climate change scenario associated with the IPCC A2 emissions scenario points to major losses for African countries, but modest gains for Northern Europe.},

It is noteworthy that vaccine efficacy depends not only on the vaccine but also on characteristics of the vaccinated. Over the past 30 years, a series of studies has documented the impact of psychological factors on the immune system's vaccine response. Robust evidence has demonstrated that stress, depression, loneliness, and poor health behaviors can impair the immune system's response to vaccines, and this effect may be greatest in vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Psychological factors are also implicated in the prevalence and severity of vaccine-related side effects. These findings have generalized across many vaccine types and therefore may be relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, we discuss these psychological and behavioral risk factors for poor vaccine responses, their relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as targeted psychological and behavioral interventions to boost vaccine efficacy and reduce side effects. Recent data suggest these psychological and behavioral risk factors are highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but intervention research suggests that psychological and behavioral interventions can increase vaccine efficacy.},

Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress.

Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.},

Setting Forty-six Member States of the WHO African Region. Participants No participants. Main outcome measures The state of data sources, including censuses, surveys, vital registration and health care facility-based sources. Results In almost all countries of the Region, there is a heavy reliance on household surveys for most indicators, with more than 121 household surveys having been conducted in the Region since 2000. Few countries have civil registration systems that permit adequate and regular tracking of mortality and causes of death. Demographic surveillance sites function in several countries, but the data generated are not integrated into the national health information system because of concerns about representativeness. Health management information systems generate considerable data, but the information is rarely used because of concerns about bias, quality and timeliness. To date, 43 countries in the Region have initiated Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response. Conclusions A multitude of data sources are used to track progress towards health-related goals in the Region, with heavy reliance on household surveys for most indicators. Countries need to develop comprehensive national plans for health information that address the full range of data needs and data sources and that include provision for building national capacities for data generation, analysis, dissemination and use.},

This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ)., In our sample (n~=~500), 62\% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4\% and 18.6\% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p~{$<~$}0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p~{$<~$}0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p~=~0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ ``Need for approval'' (OR: 1.08; p~=~0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ ``Confidence'' (OR: 0.89; p~=~0.002) and ``Discomfort with closeness'' were protective (OR: 0.92; p~=~0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p~=~0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p~=~0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ ``Confidence'' (OR: 0.92; p~=~0.039) and ``Discomfort with closeness'' (OR: 0.94; p~=~0.023) were protective., Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.},

Ultimately, the level of anxiety was significantly higher among people who had at least one family member, relative, or friend who contracted COVID-19 disease (95 \% CI [1.2, 35.03], p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The health care system should adopt a package of psychosocial interventions to reduce the anxiety of high risk groups.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined national trends in 12-month prevalence of major depressive episodes (MDEs) in adolescents and young adults overall and in different sociodemographic groups, as well as trends in depression treatment between 2005 and 2014. METHODS: Data were drawn from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health for 2005 to 2014, which are annual cross-sectional surveys of the US general population. Participants included 172 495 adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 178 755 adults aged 18 to 25. Time trends in 12-month prevalence of MDEs were examined overall and in different subgroups, as were time trends in the use of treatment services. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of MDEs increased from 8.7\% in 2005 to 11.3\% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8\% to 9.6\% in young adults (both P {$<$} .001). The increase was larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adults has increased in recent years. In the context of little change in mental health treatments, trends in prevalence translate into a growing number of young people with untreated depression. The findings call for renewed efforts to expand service capacity to best meet the mental health care needs of this age group.},

Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL estimates and each study's particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately \$1.5 million to \$2.5 million (in 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when ``best practice'' assumptions are invoked. This range is considerably below many previous qualitative reviews of this literature. \textcopyright{} 2002 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Provision of financial incentives is a promising intervention for improving adherence in patients taking antipsychotic medication. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of this intervention for improving adherence to antipsychotic depot medication in patients with psychotic disorders, irrespective of their previous compliance. METHODS: We did this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at three mental health-care institutions in secondary psychiatric care services in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years, had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, had been prescribed antipsychotic depot medication or had an indication to start using depot medication, and were participating in outpatient treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via computer-generated randomisation with a block size of four, to receive 12 months of either treatment as usual plus a financial reward for each depot of medication received (\texteuro 30 per month if fully compliant; intervention group) or treatment as usual alone (control group). Randomisation was stratified by treatment site and suspected prognostic factors: sex, comorbid substance-use disorder (absent vs present), and compliance with antipsychotic medication in the 4 months before baseline ({$<$}50\% vs {$\geq$}50\%). Patients, clinicians, interviewers, and research assistants were masked to group allocation before, but not after, group assignment. The primary outcome was the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), defined as the number of depots of antipsychotic medication received divided by the total number of depots of antipsychotic medication prescribed during the 12 month intervention period. Patients were followed up for 6 months, during which time no monetary rewards were offered for taking antipsychotic medication. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Nederlands Trial Register, number NTR2350. FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2010, and Oct 15, 2014, we randomly assigned 169 patients to the intervention group (n=84) or the control group (n=85). Primary outcome data were available for 155 (92\%) patients. At baseline, the mean MPR was 76{$\cdot$}0\% (SD 28{$\cdot$}2\%) in the intervention group versus 77{$\cdot$}9\% (28{$\cdot$}5\%) in the control group. At 12 months, the mean MPR was higher in the intervention group (94{$\cdot$}3\% [SD 11{$\cdot$}3\%]) than in the control group (80{$\cdot$}3\% [19{$\cdot$}1\%]), with an adjusted difference of 14{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% CI 8{$\cdot$}9-20{$\cdot$}9\%; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). This difference was maintained throughout the 6 month follow-up period: mean MPR of 86{$\cdot$}6\% (SD 22{$\cdot$}2\%) in the intervention group versus 76{$\cdot$}0\% (22{$\cdot$}7\%) in the control group (adjusted difference 6{$\cdot$}5\%, 95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}0-10{$\cdot$}9; p=0{$\cdot$}047). INTERPRETATION: Financial incentives are an effective way of improving adherence to antipsychotic depot medication among patients with psychotic disorders. Further research is needed to study the long-term effects of this intervention. FUNDING: Dual Diagnosis Center.},

To do so, we couple meteorological and climatic data with reported mental health difficulties drawn from nearly 2 million randomly sampled US residents between 2002 and 2012. We find that shifting from monthly temperatures between 25 \textdegree C and 30 \textdegree C to {$>$}30 \textdegree C increases the probability of mental health difficulties by 0.5\% points, that 1\textdegree C of 5-year warming associates with a 2\% point increase in the prevalence of mental health issues, and that exposure to Hurricane Katrina associates with a 4\% point increase in this metric. Our analyses provide added quantitative support for the conclusion that environmental stressors produced by climate change pose threats to human mental health.},

With continuing climate change, it is important to understand what drought is and how it may affect the mental health. We quantified drought in terms of duration and intensity of relative dryness and identified drought characteristics associated with poor mental health to evaluate any vulnerability in rural and urban communities. Our methods involved analysis of 100-year longitudinal records of monthly rainfall linked to one wave (2007\textendash 2008) of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Cluster analysis was used to characterise different patterns of dryness and linear regression analysis was used to examine associations with participant distress, as well as the moderating role of rural locality. The results showed that, during a seven-year period of major and widespread drought, one pattern of relative dryness (extreme cumulative number of months in drought culminating in a recent period of dryness lasting a year or more) was associated with increased distress for rural but not urban dwellers. The increase in distress was estimated to be 6.22\%, based on 95\% confidence intervals. Thus, we show that it is possible to quantitatively identify an association between patterns of drought and distress.},

The first is Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), an infection related to Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS was the first new-found plague of this century. Zika virus, which is similar to yellow fever virus in being transmitted by mosquitos, is another of the recent scourges. Zika appearing for the first time in the Americas is associated with birth defects and a paralytic condition in adults. Lastly, illness due to hepatitis viruses were observed prominently during the second World War initially associated with blood transfusions and vaccine inoculations. Since then, hepatitis virus infections have afflicted millions of individuals, in some leading to an acute fulminating liver disease or more often to a life-long persistent infection. A subset of those infected has developed liver cancer. However, in a triumph of medical treatments for infectious diseases, pharmaceuticals have been developed whose use virtually eliminates such maladies. For example, Hepatitis C virus infection has been eliminated from almost all ({$>$}97\%) of its victims. This incredible result was the by-product of basic research in virology as well as cell and molecular biology during which intelligent drugs were designed to block events in the hepatitis virus life-cycle"--},

The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated. Results: In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6\% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1\% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety. Conclusion: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease. Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.},

Though it was successful in a number of countries, eradication failed in most of the developing world. Studies that have examined the failure of malaria eradication have focused on the various technical, organizational, and financial problems which hampered the program. While these critiques are valid, they lose sight of the wider political, economic and cultural context within which eradication was conceived and executed. Malaria eradication was a product of a postwar vision of economic and social development and needs to be examined in this context. Many of the problems that plagued eradication efforts flowed from this intense association between eradication and "development".},

Climate change is a global challenge which is likely to affect the mankind in substantial ways. Not only climate change is expected to affect physical health, it is also likely to affect mental health. Increasing ambient temperatures is likely to increase rates of aggression and violent suicides, while prolonged droughts due to climate change can lead to more number of farmer suicides. Droughts otherwise can lead to impaired mental health and stress. Increased frequency of disasters with climate change can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and depression. Changes in climate and global warming may require population to migrate, which can lead to acculturation stress. It can also lead to increased rates of physical illnesses, which secondarily would be associated with psychological distress. The possible effects of mitigation measures on mental health are also discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of what can and should be done to tackle the expected mental health issues consequent to climate change.},

  abstract = {The burden of mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders increased by 41\% between 1990 and 2010 and now accounts for one in every 10 lost years of health globally. This sobering statistic does not take into account the substantial excess mortality associated with these disorders or the social and economic consequences of MNS disorders on affected persons, their caregivers, and society. A wide variety of effective interventions, including drugs, psychological treatments, and social interventions, can prevent and treat MNS disorders. At the population-level platform of service delivery, best practices include legislative measures to restrict access to means of self-harm or suicide and to reduce the availability of and demand for alcohol. At the community-level platform, best practices include life-skills training in schools to build social and emotional competencies. At the health-care-level platform, we identify three delivery channels. Two of these delivery channels are especially relevant from a public health perspective: self-management (eg, web-based psychological therapy for depression and anxiety disorders) and primary care and community outreach (eg, non-specialist health worker delivering psychological and pharmacological management of selected disorders). The third delivery channel, hospital care, which includes specialist services for MNS disorders and first-level hospitals providing other types of services (such as general medicine, HIV, or paediatric care), play an important part for a smaller proportion of cases with severe, refractory, or emergency presentations and for the integration of mental health care in other health-care channels, respectively. The costs of providing a significantly scaled up package of specified cost-effective interventions for prioritised MNS disorders in low-income and lower-middle-income countries is estimated at US\$3-4 per head of population per year. Since a substantial proportion of MNS disorders run a chronic and disabling course and adversely affect household welfare, intervention costs should largely be met by government through increased resource allocation and financial protection measures (rather than leaving households to pay out-of-pocket). Moreover, a policy of moving towards universal public finance can also be expected to lead to a far more equitable allocation of public health resources across income groups. Despite this evidence, less than 1\% of development assistance for health and government spending on health in low-income and middle-income countries is allocated to the care of people with these disorders. Achieving the health gains associated with prioritised interventions will require not just financial resources, but committed and sustained efforts to address a range of other barriers (such as paucity of human resources, weak governance, and stigma). Ultimately, the goal is to massively increase opportunities for people with MNS disorders to access services without the prospect of discrimination or impoverishment and with the hope of attaining optimal health and social outcomes.},

Most studies showed an association between indicators of poverty and the risk of mental disorders, the most consistent association being with low levels of education. A review of articles exploring the mechanism of the relationship suggested weak evidence to support a specific association with income levels. Factors such as the experience of insecurity and hopelessness, rapid social change and the risks of violence and physical ill-health may explain the greater vulnerability of the poor to common mental disorders. The direct and indirect costs of mental ill-health worsen the economic condition, setting up a vicious cycle of poverty and mental disorder. Common mental disorders need to be placed alongside other diseases associated with poverty by policy-makers and donors. Programmes such as investment in education and provision of microcredit may have unanticipated benefits in reducing the risk of mental disorders. Secondary prevention must focus on strengthening the ability of primary care services to provide effective treatment.},

  abstract = {Background The value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) is the central number for the economic allocation of health resources. Nevertheless, empirical data on VSLY are lacking for most low- and middle- income countries. In the absence of empirically established VSLY, researchers typically use an arbitrary 3-times multiple of per-capita gross domestic product or per-capita income per life-year saved to establish cost-effectiveness. Objective In this study, we establish an empirical VSLY for the first time for a community in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods To empirically establish VSLY, we randomly selected 4000 individuals in the Ukonga community of Tanzania and employed a contingent valuation survey to measure VSLY. Using the contingent valuation methodology, we elicited willingness to pay for a 2\% mortality risk reduction and had individuals convert this into an annualized payment to be paid each year over their expected remaining life. Results We compared our elicited value to per-capita income and found that mean VSLY is \$9340 (95\% CI \$6206-\$12\,373). The mean annual income in our sample was \$2069, resulting in a VSLY that is equivalent to 4.5 times per-capita income. Conclusion Our results provide empirical evidence to support moving away from using the World Health Organization cost-effectiveness thresholds in practice because they will likely result in inefficient underinvestment in cost-effective interventions, even in relatively poor samples.},

Methods We pretested, and then administered a comprehensive interview to family members and close associates of 519 people who committed suicide and of 536 people who died from other injuries (controls) randomly selected from 23 geographically representative sites in China. Findings After adjustment for sex, age, location of residence, and research site, eight significant predictors of suicide remained in the final unconditional logistic regression model. In order of importance they were: high depression symptom score, previous suicide attempt, acute stress at time of death, low quality of life, high chronic stress, severe interpersonal conflict in the 2 days before death, a blood relative with previous suicidal behaviour, and a friend or associate with previous suicidal behaviour. Suicide risk increased substantially with exposure to multiple risk factors: none of the 265 deceased people who were exposed to one or fewer of the eight risk factors died by suicide, but 30\% (90/299) with two or three risk factors, 85\% (320/377) with four or five risk factors, and 96\% (109/114) with six or more risk factors died by suicide. Interpretation Despite substantial differences between characteristics of people who commit suicide in China and the west, risk factors for suicide do not differ greatly. Suicide prevention programmes what concentrate on a single risk factor are unlikely to reduce suicide rates substantially; preventive efforts should focus on individuals exposed to multiple risk factors.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Since Doll published the first PAF in 1951, it has been a mainstay. Confusion in terminology abounds with regard to these measures. The ability to estimate all of them in case-control studies as well as in cohort studies is not widely appreciated. Methods: This article reviews and comments on the historical development of the population attributable fraction (PAF), the exposed attributable fraction (EAF), the rate difference (ID), the population rate (or incidence) difference (PID), and the caseload difference (CD). Results: The desire for PAFs to sum to no more than 100\% and the interpretation of the complement of a PAF as the proportion of a rate that can be attributed to other causes are shown to stem from the same problem: a failure to recognize the pervasiveness of shared etiologic responsibility among causes. A lack of appreciation that ``expected'' numbers of cases and deaths are not actually the numbers to be expected when an exposure or intervention appreciably affects person-time denominators for rates, as in the case of smoking and nonnormal body mass, makes many CD estimates inflated. A movement may be gaining momentum to shift away from assuming, often unrealistically, the complete elimination of harmful exposures and toward estimating the effects of realistic interventions. This movement could culminate in a merger of the academic concept of transportability with the applied discipline of risk assessment. Conclusions: A suggestion is offered to pay more attention to absolute measures such as the rate difference, the population rate difference, and the CD, when the latter can be validly estimated and less attention to proportional measures such as the EAF and PAF.},

In this study, the vulnerability of Madagascar's health sector to climate change was assessed and appropriate adaptation measures were identified. In order to assess climate risks, vulnerability and identify adaptation options, the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health as well as the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service worked in close collaboration with a team of local experts to conduct a literature review, field surveys, and analyses of current and future climate and health trends. Four climate-sensitive diseases of primary concern are described in the study: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, malnutrition, and malaria. Baseline conditions of these four diseases from 2000 to 2014 show acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are increasing in incidence; while incidence of malnutrition and malaria decreased over this period. To assess future impacts in Madagascar, this baseline information was used with climate projections for the two scenarios\textemdash RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5\textemdash for the periods 2016\textendash 2035, 2036\textendash 2070 and 2071\textendash 2100. Future climate conditions are shown to exacerbate and increase the incidence of all four climate sensitive diseases. Further analysis of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to the climate hazards suggests that the health sector in four regions of Madagascar is particularly vulnerable. The study recommends adaptation measures to improve the monitoring and early warning systems for climate sensitive diseases, as well as to reduce population vulnerability.},

Madagascar cannot escape cyclones, floods and drought due to its geographical situation. The objective in this work is to assess the risks and vulnerability to these hazards in order to strengthen the resilience of the Malagasy population. Our approach is based on multi-criteria spatial analysis using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results form decision spatial information that can be used at the strategic level of natural risk and disaster management. This work focuses on the degree of vulnerability and it was found in this study that the Androy and Atsimo-Atsinanana regions are the most vulnerable to major hazards in Madagascar not only because of their exposure to risk but also because of their very low socio-economic status.},

Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions. Still, further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.},

As such, it is to be expected that individuals will have a preference for particular types of climate. This paper analyses a panel of 67 countries attempting to explain differences in self-reported levels of happiness by reference to, amongst other things, temperature and precipitation. Various indices are used for each of these variables, including means, extremes and the number of hot, cold, wet and dry months. Using a panel-corrected least squares approach, the paper demonstrates that, even when controlling for a range of other factors, climate variables have a highly significant effect on country-wide self-reported levels of happiness. On the basis of these results, it is determined that differential patterns of anthropogenically induced climate change might alter dramatically the distribution of happiness between nations, with some countries moving towards a preferred climate and others moving further away. We find that high-latitude countries included in our dataset might benefit from temperature changes. Countries already characterized by very high summer temperatures would most likely suffer losses from climate change.},

In global health, interventions that impose costs per disability-adjusted life year averted less than three and one times gross domestic product per capita are often considered cost-effective and very cost-effective, respectively. This article explores the conceptual foundation and derivation of these thresholds. Its goal is to promote understanding of how these thresholds were derived and their implications, as well as to suggest options for improvement. These thresholds are intended to reflect the monetary value of the benefits to affected individuals, based on their preferences for spending on health vs spending on other goods and services. However, the current values were not rigorously derived, which means that their application may lead to inappropriate conclusions regarding which interventions should be adopted as well as misallocation of resources across health and other investments. Improving the basis for these cost-effectiveness thresholds is of particular importance in low- and middle-income countries, given the limited resources available and the significant needs of their populations.},

  abstract = {The estimates used to value mortality risk reductions are a major determinant of the benefits of many public health and environmental policies. These estimates (typically expressed as the value per statistical life, VSL) describe the willingness of those affected by a policy to exchange their own income for the risk reductions they experience. While these values are relatively well studied in high-income countries, less is known about the values held by lower-income populations. We identify 26 studies conducted in the 172 countries considered low- or middle-income in any of the past 20 years; several have significant limitations. Thus there are few or no direct estimates of VSL for most such countries. Instead, analysts typically extrapolate values from wealthier countries, adjusting only for income differences. This extrapolation requires selecting a base value and an income elasticity that summarizes the rate at which VSL changes with income. Because any such approach depends on assumptions of uncertain validity, we recommend that analysts conduct a standardized sensitivity analysis to assess the extent to which their conclusions change depending on these estimates. In the longer term, more research on the value of mortality risk reductions in low- and middle-income countries is essential.},

  abstract = {Objectives We aimed to develop a systematic synthesis of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change, by synthesising studies' characteristics, climate impacts, health outcomes and key findings. Design We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change. We registered our review in PROSPERO (CRD42019145972). No ethical approval was required since we used secondary data. Additional data are not available. Data sources On 22 June 2019, we searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria We included systematic reviews that explored at least one health impact of climate change. Data extraction and synthesis We organised systematic reviews according to their key characteristics, including geographical regions, year of publication and authors' affiliations. We mapped the climate effects and health outcomes being studied and synthesised major findings. We used a modified version of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) to assess the quality of studies. Results We included 94 systematic reviews. Most were published after 2015 and approximately one-fifth contained meta-analyses. Reviews synthesised evidence about five categories of climate impacts; the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events. Reviews covered 10 health outcome categories; the 3 most common were (1) infectious diseases, (2) mortality and (3) respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological outcomes. Most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, although the majority also called for more research. Conclusions Most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health. This study provides a comprehensive higher order summary of research on health impacts of climate change. Study limitations include possible missed relevant reviews, no meta-meta-analyses, and no assessment of overlap. Future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include broader sociopsychological health impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Mental health concerns and treatment usually take a backseat when the limited resources are geared  for pandemic containment. In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have been reported from all over the world. Objectives: In this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive strategies established in mental health care with special reference to the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar were undertaken using the search terms `novel coronavirus', `COVID-19', `nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, `mental health', `psychiatry', `psychology', `anxiety', `depression' and `stress' in various permutations and combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles, official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and non-government organizations, verified social media portals were compiled. Results: The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people, frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India. Conclusion: Keeping a positive approach, developing vulnerable-group-specific need-based interventions with proper risk communication strategies and keeping at par with the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 would be instrumental in guiding the planning and prioritization of mental health care resources to serve the most vulnerable.},

Online search engines harvest vast amounts of data from the general population in real time and make these data publicly accessible via such tools as Google Trends (GT). Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the literature about possible use of GT for COVID-19 surveillance and prediction of its outbreaks. We collected and reviewed articles about the possible use of GT for COVID-19 surveillance published in the first 2 years of the pandemic. We resulted in 54 publications that were used in this review. The majority of the studies (83.3\%) included in this review showed positive results of the possible use of GT for forecasting COVID-19 outbreaks. Most of the studies were performed in English-speaking countries (61.1\%). The most frequently used keyword was ``coronavirus'' (53.7\%), followed by ``COVID-19'' (31.5\%) and ``COVID'' (20.4\%). Many authors have made analyses in multiple countries (46.3\%) and obtained the same results for the majority of them, thus showing the robustness of the chosen methods. Various methods including long short-term memory (3.7\%), random forest regression (3.7\%), Adaboost algorithm (1.9\%), autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network autoregression (1.9\%), and vector error correction modeling (1.9\%) were used for the analysis. It was seen that most of the publications with positive results (72.2\%) were using data from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, the search volumes reduced even though the incidence peaked. In most countries, the use of GT data showed to be beneficial for forecasting and surveillance of COVID-19 spread.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study assesses health losses from diseases, injuries, and risk factors using disability-adjusted life-years, which need a set of disability weights to quantify health levels associated with non-fatal outcomes. The objective of this study was to estimate disability weights for the GBD 2013 study. METHODS: We analysed data from new web-based surveys of participants aged 18-65 years, completed in four European countries (Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden) between Sept 23, 2013, and Nov 11, 2013, combined with data previously collected in the GBD 2010 disability weights measurement study. Surveys used paired comparison questions for which respondents considered two hypothetical individuals with different health states and specified which person they deemed healthier than the other. These surveys covered 183 health states pertinent to GBD 2013; of these states, 30 were presented with descriptions revised from previous versions and 18 were new to GBD 2013. We analysed paired comparison data using probit regression analysis and rescaled results to disability weight units between 0 (no loss of health) and 1 (loss equivalent to death). We compared results with previous estimates, and an additional analysis examined sensitivity of paired comparison responses to duration of hypothetical health states. FINDINGS: The total analysis sample consisted of 30\hphantom{,}230 respondents from the GBD 2010 surveys and 30\hphantom{,}660 from the new European surveys. For health states common to GBD 2010 and GBD 2013, results were highly correlated overall (Pearson's r 0{$\cdot$}992 [95\% uncertainty interval 0{$\cdot$}989-0{$\cdot$}994]). For health state descriptions that were revised for this study, resulting disability weights were substantially different for a subset of these weights, including those related to hearing loss (eg, complete hearing loss: GBD 2010 0{$\cdot$}033 [0{$\cdot$}020-0{$\cdot$}052]; GBD 2013 0{$\cdot$}215 [0{$\cdot$}144-0{$\cdot$}307]) and treated spinal cord lesions (below the neck: GBD 2010 0{$\cdot$}047 [0{$\cdot$}028-0{$\cdot$}072]; GBD 2013 0{$\cdot$}296 [0{$\cdot$}198-0{$\cdot$}414]; neck level: GBD 2010 0{$\cdot$}369 [0{$\cdot$}243-0{$\cdot$}513]; GBD 2013 0{$\cdot$}589 [0{$\cdot$}415-0{$\cdot$}748]). Survey responses to paired comparison questions were insensitive to whether the comparisons were framed in terms of temporary or chronic outcomes (Pearson's r 0{$\cdot$}981 [0{$\cdot$}973-0{$\cdot$}987]). INTERPRETATION: This study substantially expands the empirical basis for assessment of non-fatal outcomes in the GBD study. Findings from this study substantiate the notion that disability weights are sensitive to particular details in descriptions of health states, but robust to duration of outcomes.

After its outbreak in late December in Wuhan China, it has expanded to affect the entire world. In as much as it is a new disease, there is dearth of evidence. Aim: The aim of this study is to find and assess the factors associated with self-perceived stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal. Method: We evaluated 374 respondents from an online survey, using the Sheldon Cohen Perceived Stress Scale, to assess stress levels during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal. Results: Nearly three-quarters of the respondents rated their self-perceived stress as moderate to high, and about one quarter reported to have low self-perceived stress. Age and employment status were associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak. Conclusions: There is a need to carry out psychological intervention activities through various mediums to help people become more resilient during the COVID-19 epidemic. [Ethiop. J.

Given this working terrain, patient adherence with antidepressant therapy is a critical aspect of effective clinical management. However, according to contemporary data (i.e., over the past 10 years), approximately 50 percent of psychiatric patients and 50 percent of primary care patients prematurely discontinue antidepressant therapy (i.e., are nonadherent when assessed at six-months after the initiation of treatment). The reasons behind patient nonadherence to antidepressants are varied and include both patient factors (e.g., concerns about side effects, fears of addiction, belief that these medications will not really address personal problems) as well as clinician factors (e.g., lack of sufficient patient education, poor follow-up). An awareness of the high rates of antidepressant nonadherence among patients hopefully will underscore to the prescriber the importance of carefully exploring patient concerns about these medications and closely monitoring patients while on therapy.},

  abstract = {Introduction Climate change and climate-related disasters adversely affect mental health. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and climate-related disasters and often lack adequate mental healthcare infrastructure. We used the scoping review methodology to determine how exposure to climate change and climate-related disasters influences the presence of mental disorders among those living in LMICs. We also aimed to recognise existing gaps in this area of literature. Methods This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. To identify relevant studies, we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo and Sociological Abstracts) from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2019. We also searched the grey literature. Included studies had an adult-focused LMIC population, a climate change or climate-related disaster exposure and a mental disorder outcome. Relevant study information was extracted and synthesised. Results Fifty-eight studies were identified, most of which (n=48) employed a cross-sectional design. The most commonly studied exposure\textendash outcome combinations were flood-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=28), flood-related depression (n=15) and storm-related PTSD (n=13). The majority of studies identified a positive exposure\textendash outcome association. However, few studies included a baseline or comparator (ie, unexposed) group, thereby limiting our understanding of the magnitude or nature of this association. There was also great heterogeneity in this literature, making studies difficult to pool or compare. Several research gaps were identified including the lack of longitudinal studies and non-uniformity of geographic coverage. Conclusion To our knowledge, this was the first scoping review to investigate the relationship between climate change and climate-related disaster exposures and mental disorder outcomes in LMICs. Our findings support the need for further research, but also highlight that mental health should be a priority within LMIC climate change policy considerations.},

  abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profound psychological and social effects. The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression and insomnia in the general population and among healthcare professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis, it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Materials and Methods: The research method was descriptive a correlational. The study samples included 210 veterans, who had records in the Veterans Foundation in Tehran's number one district, Sarallah and Imam Khomeini shelters and Essaar Sports Center in Tehran. They were selected randomly and were asked to respond to questionnaires on mental health, spiritual well-being, life satisfaction, social support, and self-efficacy. The data was analyzed by LISREL software version 8.5, using the path analysis. Results: The results showed that the designed model fitted the data (AGFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00 and NFI = 1.00). In the fitted model, life satisfaction and spiritual well-being directly, and social support indirectly, had a significant relationship with the mediator variable of life satisfaction of the war veterans' mental health. Conclusions: Veterans with better social support, life satisfaction, and spiritual well-being have better mental health.},

One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods: This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results: Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Conclusion: Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Climate change projections indicate that droughts will become more intense in the 21 century in some areas of the world. The El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation is associated with drought in some countries, and forecasts can provide advance warning of the increased risk of adverse climate conditions. The most recent available data from EMDAT estimates that over 50 million people globally were affected by drought in 2011. Documentation of the health effects of drought is difficult, given the complexity in assigning a beginning/end and because effects tend to accumulate over time. Most health impacts are indirect because of its link to other mediating circumstances like loss of livelihoods. Methods. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Embase; PsychINFO, Cochrane Collection. Key references from extracted papers were hand-searched, and advice from experts was sought for further sources of literature. Inclusion criteria for papers summarised in tables include: explicit link made between drought as exposure and human health outcomes; all study designs/methods; all countries/contexts; any year of publication. Exclusion criteria include: drought meaning shortage unrelated to climate; papers not published in English; studies on dry/arid climates unless drought was noted as an abnormal climatological event. No formal quality evaluation was used on papers meeting inclusion criteria. Results. 87 papers meeting the inclusion criteria are summarised in tables. Additionally, 59 papers not strictly meeting the inclusion criteria are used as supporting text in relevant parts of the results section. Main categories of findings include: nutrition-related effects (including general malnutrition and mortality, micronutrient malnutrition, and anti-nutrient consumption); water-related disease (including E coli, cholera and algal bloom); airborne and dust-related disease (including silo gas exposure and coccidioidomycosis); vector borne disease (including malaria, dengue and West Nile Virus); mental health effects (including distress and other emotional consequences); and other health effects (including wildfire, effects of migration, and damage to infrastructure). Conclusions. The probability of drought-related health impacts varies widely and largely depends upon drought severity, baseline population vulnerability, existing health and sanitation infrastructure, and available resources with which to mitigate impacts as they occur. The socio-economic environment in which drought occurs influences the resilience of the affected population. Forecasting can be used to provide advance warning of the increased risk of adverse climate conditions and can support the disaster risk reduction process. Despite the complexities involved in documentation, research should continue and results should be shared widely in an effort to strengthen drought preparedness and response activities.},

  abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy and refusal continue to hamper COVID-19 control efforts. Throughout the pandemic, scientists and journalists have attributed lagging COVID-19 vaccination rates to a shifting set of factors including demography, experiences during the height of the pandemic, political views, and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation, among others. However, these factors have rarely been tested comprehensively, in tandem, or alongside other potentially underlying psychological factors, thus limiting our understanding of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This cross-sectional study assesses a diverse set of correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy identified in previous studies using US survey data (N~=~2055) collected in July\textendash August 2021. The survey contained modules designed to assess various sociopolitical domains and anti- and pro-social personality characteristics hypothesized to shape vaccine hesitancy. Using logistic and multinomial regression, we found that the strongest correlate of vaccine hesitancy was belief in misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines, though we surmise that this common explanation may be endogenous to vaccine hesitancy. Political beliefs explained more variation in vaccine hesitancy\textemdash and in particular, vaccine refusal\textemdash after belief in COVID-19 vaccine misinformation was excluded from the analysis. Our findings help reconcile numerous disparate findings across the literature with implications for health education and future research.},

There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69{$\cdot$}8 million patients. TriNetX included 62 354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness.

Every year it is afflicted with various climatic disasters including floods, hurricanes and cyclones. Apart from the obvious devastation of lives and property, there is a huge increase in clinical diseases when these disasters occur. Mental health of affected persons after these disasters is a topic that is often neglected by local and national level. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A qualitative case study was conducted on perceived need on mental health support \& availability of such services in a cyclone affected area in rural Bangladesh. Ten (10) key informant interviews (KIIs) with different stakeholders and ten (10) in-depth interviews (IDIs) with affected people were taken. Findings:\hspace{0.6em} We found that cyclones had numerous psychosocial impacts on the population including acute stress disorder, sleep disorder, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs), generalized anxiety disorders, suicidal ideation and depression. The survivors had specific needs for receiving support. Children, elderly and women were perceived to be more vulnerable. The government and NGOs had no specific action plans and initiatives to address these issues and support the mental health of affected population. There was a visible gap in finding effective ways to provide affected people with the required mental health \& psycho-social services (MHPSS). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Resilient, responsive and self-sustaining health systems for this vulnerable population are required. Implementation of effective mental health programs and strong mental health policies remain a challenge in Bangladesh where there is a cultural fatalistic acceptance of mental health issues.},

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most stressful events of recent times. Among the population, healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are most likely to develop psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study thus aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian healthcare workers. Methods: The responses of 145 healthcare workers (72 medical doctors and 73 nurses) were included in the final dataset. Participants were asked to provide sociodemographic and clinical information, and to complete: 1) quality of life and health-related Visual Analogue Scales, 2) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1, 3) Beck Depression Inventory, and 4) PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Results: A comparison between healthcare professionals working in COVID-19 wards and other units revealed that the former reported higher levels of both depressive symptoms and PTSS. Moreover, the results of regression analyses showed that in healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, gender and marital status, and gender and age significantly predicted depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Particularly, being female and not in a relationship were found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, whereas being female and older were found to be related to higher levels of PTSS. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that specific predisposing factors could identify healthcare workers who are at high risk of developing mental health symptoms when faced with COVID-19 patients.},

Study design Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Methods A systematic review of published literature using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO without geographical or temporal limits was conducted. We included studies that explicitly linked high ambient temperatures and/or heat waves to mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using a National Institute of Health framework. Results A total of 35 studies were included in the review, among which 34 were observational studies and one was a case\textendash control study. Six broad mental health outcome categories were identified: suicide and heat; bipolar disorder, mania and depression and heat; schizophrenia and heat; organic mental health outcomes and heat including dementia; alcohol and substance misuse and heat; and multiple mental health outcomes/mental health service usage and heat. The studies included were heterogeneous in terms of study design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location making meta-analysis unfeasible. Fifteen studies showed an increased suicide risk with heat (relative risk [RR] 1.014\textendash 1.37 per 1~\textdegree C, P~{$<~$}0.05; r~=~0.10\textendash 0.64, P~{$<~$}0.05). Increased risks of mental health-related admissions and emergency department visits at higher temperatures were also found. No evidence of change in community care use was found. Evidence for the impact of heat on other mental health outcomes was mixed. Conclusions High ambient temperatures have a range of mental health effects. The strongest evidence was found for increased suicide risk. Limited evidence was found for an increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality among people with known mental health problems. Knowledge gaps exist on the impact of high temperatures on many common mental health disorders. Mental health impacts should be incorporated into plans for the public health response to high temperatures, and as evidence evolves, psychological morbidity and mortality temperature thresholds should be incorporated into hot weather\textendash warning systems.},

In this article, based on literature review of primary and secondary sources as well as field notes from public events, we present first a summary of the origins and evolution of the GBD over the past 25 years. We then analyse two illustrative examples of estimates and the ways in which they gloss over the assumptions and knowledge gaps in their production, highlighting the importance of historical context by country and by disease in the quality of health data. Finally, we delve into the question of the end users of these estimates and the tensions that lie at the heart of producing estimates of local, national, and global burdens of disease. These tensions bring to light the different institutional ethics and motivations of IHME, WHO, and the World Bank, and they draw our attention to the importance of estimate methodologies in representing problems and their solutions in global health. With the rise in the investment in and the power of global health estimates, the question of representing global health problems becomes ever more entangled in decisions made about how to adjust reported numbers and to evolving statistical science. Ultimately, more work needs to be done to create evidence that is relevant and meaningful on country and district levels, which means shifting resources and support for quantitative-and qualitative-data production, analysis, and synthesis to countries that are the targeted beneficiaries of such global health estimates.},

METHODS: We conducted a nonblinded, randomized controlled trial of once-weekly fluoxetine, directly observed for 24 weeks, then self-administered for 12 weeks (n = 137 persons with major or minor depressive disorder or dysthymia). Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was the primary outcome. Response was a 50\% reduction from baseline and remission a score below 8. Secondary measures were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score, antiretroviral uptake, antiretroviral adherence (measured by unannounced pill count), and HIV-1 RNA viral suppression ({$<$} 50 copies/mL). RESULTS: The intervention reduced depression symptom severity (b = -1.97; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,-0.85, -3.08; P {$<$} .001) and increased response (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.40; 95\% CI = 1.86, 3.10; P {$<$} .001) and remission (AOR = 2.97; 95\% CI = 1.29, 3.87; P {$<$} .001). BDI-II results were similar. We observed no statistically significant differences in secondary HIV outcomes.

We examined publicly available, anonymized, aggregated data on weekly trends in Google searches related to anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation from 2018 to 2020 in the US. We correlated these trends with (1) emergency department (ED) visits for mental health problems and suicide attempts, and (2) surveys of self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and mental health care use. Search queries related to anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation decreased sharply around March 2020, returning to pre-pandemic levels by summer 2020. Searches related to depression were correlated with the proportion of individuals reporting receiving therapy (r\,=\,0.73), taking medication (r\,=\,0.62) and having unmet mental healthcare needs (r\,=\,0.57) on US Census Household Pulse Survey and modestly correlated with rates of ED visits for mental health conditions. Results were similar when considering instead searches for anxiety. Searches for suicidal ideation did not correlate with external variables. These results suggest aggregated data on Internet searches can provide timely and continuous insights into population mental health and complement other existing tools in this domain.},

This review identifies factors associated with adherence and what is known about the effectiveness of adherence-enhancement programmes. A comprehensive systematic review of English language publications from January 2002 to October 2011 was conducted using the following databases: PUBMED/MEDLINE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane database. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria for adherence-enhancement evaluations. Eleven of the studies evaluated demonstrated significantly positive effects on adherence; the remaining 10 reported mixed or no effects. Similar to previous literature reviews, factors shown to be associated with adherence were multifactorial and in this analysis were grouped as patient, condition and comorbidities, therapy or treatment, patient\textendash provider relationship and healthcare system level. Adherence improved most notably in studies that included sustainable system and patient-targeted changes. Evaluating adherence-enhancement interventions is key to promoting successful approaches; however, a number of gaps exist between intervention and implementation: (1) the cost in resources and time to implement and sustain these programmes is unknown, (2) specific details about which subgroups of patients are best helped with such programmes is not clear, and (3) what specific processes or content are critical to programme success is still to be identified. There are sufficient data supporting the substantial need for planning and implementing adherence interventions despite reported mixed results. Primary care providers are often positioned to impact patients' adherence; however, practice constraints can limit their implementation.},

  abstract = {Objective: To estimate the burden of mental, neurological, substance use disorders and self-harm (MNSS) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Method: We extracted 2017 data from the Global Burden of Disease online database. Based on a previously developed framework to classify and aggregate the burden of specific disorders and symptoms, we reestimated the MNSS burden to include suicide, alcohol use, drug use, specific neurological, and painful somatic symptom disorders. We analyzed age\textendash sex-specific patterns within and between countries. Results: The MNSS burden is the largest of all disorder groupings. It is lowest in Mexico, intermediate in Canada, and highest in the United States. Exceptions are alcohol use, bipolar, conduct disorders, and epilepsy, which are highest in Mexico; and painful somatic syndromes and headaches, which are highest in Canada. The burden of drug use disorders in the United States is twice the burden in Canada, and 7 times the burden in Mexico. MNSS become the most burdensome of all disorder groups by age 10, staying at the top until age 60, and show a distinct pattern across the lifetime. The top three MNSS disorders for men are a combination of substance use disorders and self-harm (United States), with the addition of painful somatic syndromes (Canada), and headaches (Mexico). For women, the top three are headaches and depression (all countries), drug use (United States), neurocognitive disorders (Mexico), and painful somatic syndromes (Canada). Conclusion: MNSS are the most burdensome disease grouping and should be prioritized for funding in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.},

  abstract = {Background During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002\textendash 2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2\%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p~=~0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. Conclusion Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics.},

In particular, the implications of drought for mental health via pathways such as loss of livelihood, diminished social support, and rupture of place bonds have not been extensively studied, leaving a knowledge gap for practitioners and researchers alike. A systematic review of literature was performed to examine the mental health effects of drought. The systematic review results were synthesized to create a causal process diagram that illustrates the pathways linking drought effects to mental health outcomes. Eighty-two articles using a variety of methods in different contexts were gathered from the systematic review. The pathways in the causal process diagram with greatest support in the literature are those focusing on the economic and migratory effects of drought. The diagram highlights the complexity of the relationships between drought and mental health, including the multiple ways that factors can interact and lead to various outcomes. The systematic review and resulting causal process diagram can be used in both practice and theory, including prevention planning, public health programming, vulnerability and risk assessment, and research question guidance. The use of a causal process diagram provides a much needed avenue for integrating the findings of diverse research to further the understanding of the mental health implications of drought.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990\textendash 2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0\textendash 9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10\textendash 24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10\textendash 24 years were also in the top ten in the 25\textendash 49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50\textendash 74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Despite the potential importance of understanding excess mortality among people with mental disorders, no comprehensive meta-analyses have been conducted quantifying mortality across mental disorders. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality among people with mental disorders and examine differences in mortality risks by type of death, diagnosis, and study characteristics. DATA SOURCES: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science from inception through May 7, 2014, including references of eligible articles. Our search strategy included terms for mental disorders (eg, mental disorders, serious mental illness, and severe mental illness), specific diagnoses (eg, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), and mortality. We also used Google Scholar to identify articles that cited eligible articles. STUDY SELECTION: English-language cohort studies that reported a mortality estimate of mental disorders compared with a general population or controls from the same study setting without mental illness were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed the titles, abstracts, and articles. Of 2481 studies identified, 203 articles met the eligibility criteria and represented 29 countries in 6 continents. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One reviewer conducted a full abstraction of all data, and 2 reviewers verified accuracy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality estimates (eg, standardized mortality ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and years of potential life lost) comparing people with mental disorders and the general population or people without mental disorders. We used random-effects meta-analysis models to pool mortality ratios for all, natural, and unnatural causes of death. We also examined years of potential life lost and estimated the population attributable risk of mortality due to mental disorders. RESULTS: For all-cause mortality, the pooled relative risk of mortality among those with mental disorders (from 148 studies) was 2.22 (95\% CI, 2.12-2.33). Of these, 135 studies revealed that mortality was significantly higher among people with mental disorders than among the comparison population. A total of 67.3\% of deaths among people with mental disorders were due to natural causes, 17.5\% to unnatural causes, and the remainder to other or unknown causes. The median years of potential life lost was 10 years (n\,=\,24 studies). We estimate that 14.3\% of deaths worldwide, or approximately 8 million deaths each year, are attributable to mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These estimates suggest that mental disorders rank among the most substantial causes of death worldwide. Efforts to quantify and address the global burden of illness need to better consider the role of mental disorders in preventable mortality.},

  abstract = {Objective: The authors examined the disruption of ongoing treatments among individuals with preexisting mental disorders and the failure to initiate treatment among individuals with new-onset mental disorders in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Methods: English-speaking adult Katrina survivors (N=1,043) responded to a telephone survey administered between January and March of 2006. The survey assessed posthurricane treatment of emotional problems and barriers to treatment among respondents with preexisting mental disorders as well as those with new-onset disorders posthurricane. Results: Among respondents with preexisting mental disorders who reported using mental health services in the year before the hurricane, 22.9\% experienced reduction in or termination of treatment after Katrina. Among those respondents without preexisting mental disorders who developed new-onset disorders after the hurricane, 18.5\% received some form of treatment for emotional problems. Reasons for failing to continue treatment among preexisting cases primarily involved structural barriers to treatment, while reasons for failing to seek treatment among new-onset cases primarily involved low perceived need for treatment. The majority (64.5\%) of respondents receiving treatment post-Katrina were treated by general medical providers and received medication but no psychotherapy. Treatment of new-onset cases was positively related to age and income, while continued treatment of preexisting cases was positively related to race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites) and having health insurance. Conclusions: Many Hurricane Katrina survivors with mental disorders experienced unmet treatment needs, including frequent disruptions of existing care and widespread failure to initiate treatment for new-onset disorders. Future disaster management plans should anticipate both types of treatment needs.},

  abstract = {Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8\% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5\% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8\% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1\% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20\textendash 24 h per day at home (84.7\%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2\%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1\%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p {$<$} 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.},

Evidence has suggested that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness. Therefore, we investigate the general population's psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1\textendash 4, 2020. The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the influence factors of psychological distress. General population's psychological distress were significant differences based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p {$<$}0.001) except gender (p = 0.316). The population with younger age (F = 102.04), unmarried (t = 15.28), with history of visiting Wuhan in the past month (t = -40.86), with history of epidemics occurring in the community (t = -10.25), more concern with media reports (F = 21.84), perceived more impacts of the epidemic outbreak (changes over living situations, F = 331.71; emotional control, F = 1863.07; epidemic-related dreams, F = 1642.78) and negative coping style (t = 37.41) had higher level of psychological distress. Multivariate analysis found that marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, perceived impacts of the epidemic and coping style were the influence factors of psychological distress (all p {$<$}0.001). Epidemic of COVID-19 caused high level of psychological distress. The general mainland Chinese population with unmarried, history of visiting Wuhan in the past month, perceived more impacts of the epidemic and negative coping style had higher level of psychological distress in the early stages of COVID-19 epidemic. Psychological interventions should be implemented early, especially for those general population with such characteristics.},

Methods:~600 valid questionnaires were received. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale~(SDS) were used. Results:~Females' anxiety risk was 3.01 times compared to males (95\%~CI~1.39-6.52). Compared with people below 40~years old, the anxiety risk of people above 40~years old was 0.40 times (95\%~CI~0.16-0.99). SDS results indicated that~the difference between education level and occupation was statistically significant (p~=~0.024, 0.005). Compared to people with a master's degree or above, those with a bachelor's degree group had a depression risk of 0.39 times (95\%~CI~0.17-0.87). Compared with professionals, industrial service workers and other staff had a depression risk of 0.31 times (95\%~CI~0.15-0.65) and 0.38 times (95\%~CI~0.15-0.93). Conclusions:~600 questionnaire participants were psychologically stable. Non-anxiety and non-depression rates were 93.67\% and 82.83\%, respectively. There were anxiety in 6.33\% and depression in 17.17\%. Therefore, we should pay attention to the psychological states of the public.},

  abstract = {Background We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs). Methods For each of the 20 mental and substance use disorders included in GBD 2010, we systematically reviewed epidemiological data and used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR, to model prevalence by age, sex, country, region, and year. We obtained disability weights from representative community surveys and an internet-based survey to calculate YLDs. We calculated premature mortality as YLLs from cause of death estimates for 1980\textendash 2010 for 20 age groups, both sexes, and 187 countries. We derived DALYs from the sum of YLDs and YLLs. We adjusted burden estimates for comorbidity and present them with 95\% uncertainty intervals. Findings In 2010, mental and substance use disorders accounted for 183{$\cdot$}9 million DALYs (95\% UI 153{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 216{$\cdot$}7 million), or 7{$\cdot$}4\% (6{$\cdot$}2\textendash 8{$\cdot$}6) of all DALYs worldwide. Such disorders accounted for 8{$\cdot$}6 million YLLs (6{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 12{$\cdot$}1 million; 0{$\cdot$}5\% [0{$\cdot$}4\textendash 0{$\cdot$}7] of all YLLs) and 175{$\cdot$}3 million YLDs (144{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 207{$\cdot$}8 million; 22{$\cdot$}9\% [18{$\cdot$}6\textendash 27{$\cdot$}2] of all YLDs). Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of YLDs worldwide. Depressive disorders accounted for 40{$\cdot$}5\% (31{$\cdot$}7\textendash 49{$\cdot$}2) of DALYs caused by mental and substance use disorders, with anxiety disorders accounting for 14{$\cdot$}6\% (11{$\cdot$}2\textendash 18{$\cdot$}4), illicit drug use disorders for 10{$\cdot$}9\% (8{$\cdot$}9\textendash 13{$\cdot$}2), alcohol use disorders for 9{$\cdot$}6\% (7{$\cdot$}7\textendash 11{$\cdot$}8), schizophrenia for 7{$\cdot$}4\% (5{$\cdot$}0\textendash 9{$\cdot$}8), bipolar disorder for 7{$\cdot$}0\% (4{$\cdot$}4\textendash 10{$\cdot$}3), pervasive developmental disorders for 4{$\cdot$}2\% (3{$\cdot$}2\textendash 5{$\cdot$}3), childhood behavioural disorders for 3{$\cdot$}4\% (2{$\cdot$}2\textendash 4{$\cdot$}7), and eating disorders for 1{$\cdot$}2\% (0{$\cdot$}9\textendash 1{$\cdot$}5). DALYs varied by age and sex, with the highest proportion of total DALYs occurring in people aged 10\textendash 29 years. The burden of mental and substance use disorders increased by 37{$\cdot$}6\% between 1990 and 2010, which for most disorders was driven by population growth and ageing. Interpretation Despite the apparently small contribution of YLLs\textemdash with deaths in people with mental disorders coded to the physical cause of death and suicide coded to the category of injuries under self-harm\textemdash our findings show the striking and growing challenge that these disorders pose for health systems in developed and developing regions. In view of the magnitude of their contribution, improvement in population health is only possible if countries make the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders a public health priority.

  abstract = {Medicines account for 20-60\% of health spending in low- and middle-income countries, compared with 18\% in countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Up to 90\% of the population in developing countries purchase medicines through out-of-pocket payments, making medicines the largest family expenditure item after food. As a result, medicines, particularly those with higher costs, may be unaffordable for large sections of the global population and are a major burden on government budgets. The Millennium Development Goals include the target: "In cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to affordable, essential drugs in developing countries." Initiatives to stimulate availability and access through manufacturing innovations, procurement mechanisms, or supply chain improvements require management of pricing to have sustainable impact. The past ten years have seen the introduction of several initiatives at both global and regional levels to support countries in managing pharmaceutical prices. Despite some clear successes, many countries are still failing to implement the policy and programme changes needed to improve access to affordable medicines. This guideline was developed to assist national policy-makers and other stakeholders in identifying and implementing policies to manage pharmaceutical prices. Although the feasibility of these policies in countries of all income levels was considered, special consideration was given to implementation needs in low- and middle-income countries, where the pharmaceutical sector may be less regulated. References to low- and middleincome countries are therefore intended to highlight specific implementation needs and do not to exclude the appropriateness for high-income settings.--Page 4 of cover.},

  abstract = {Background: Mental disorders represent a major contributor to disease burden worldwide. We sought to quantify the national economic burden of mental disorders in China. Methods: We used a prevalence-based, bottom-up approach to estimate the economic costs of mental disorders in 2005\textendash 2013 in China. Prevalence data were derived from a national survey. Cost data were derived from the electronic health records of two psychiatric hospitals that consisted of 25,289 outpatients (10 \%) and inpatients (90 \%) who were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Cost items included direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs. Results: The total annual costs of mental disorders in China increased from \$1,094.8 in 2005 to \$3,665.4 in 2013 for individual patients, and from \$21.0 billion to \$88.8 billion for the whole society. The total costs of mental disorders in 2013 accounted for more than 15 \% of the total health expenditure in China, and 1.1 \% of China's gross domestic product. If the needs of the professional care for all patients with mental illnesses were fully met, the potential economic costs would have been almost five times higher than the actual estimated costs. Conclusions: Mental disorders imposed a huge economic burden on individuals and the society in China. A nation-wide strategic action plan for preventing mental disorders and promoting mental health and well-being is in urgent need to reduce the individual and societal costs of mental illnesses.},

  abstract = {Background Little is known about the association between ambient temperature and cause-specific mental disorders, especially in subtropical areas. Objective To investigate the effect of ambient temperature on mental disorders in subtropical cities. Method Daily morbidity data for mental disorders in three Chinese cities (Shenzhen, Zhaoqing, and Huizhou) were collected from medical record systems of local psychiatric specialist hospitals, covering patients of all ages. Case-crossover design combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to assess the nonlinear and delayed effects of temperatures on five specific mental disorders (affective disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and organic mental disorders), with analyses stratified by gender and age. The temperature of minimum effect was used as the reference value to calculate estimates. Results We observed inversed J-shaped exposure-response curves between temperature and mental morbidity and observed that low temperatures had a significant and prolonged effect on most types of mental disorders in the three cities. For example, the effect of the cold (2.5th percentile) on anxiety was consistently observed in the three cities with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.29 (95\% CI: 1.06\textendash 1.57) in Zhaoqing, 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.18\textendash 1.34) in Shenzhen, and 1.45 (95\% CI: 1.17\textendash 1.81) in Huizhou. Low temperature was also associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders and schizophrenia. For the high temperature exposure (97.5th percentile), we only observed a significant, harmful effect on anxiety [OR~=~1.30 (95\% CI: 1.08, 1.58) in Shenzhen, OR~=~1.16 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.34) in Zhaoqing], affective disorders [OR~=~1.32 (95\% CI: 1.08, 1.62) in Shenzhen], and schizophrenia [OR~=~1.24 (95\% CI: 1.03, 1.48) in Zhaoqing, OR~=~1.03 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.06) in Huizhou]. Conclusions Our study suggests that both low and high temperatures might be important drivers of morbidity from mental disorders, and low temperature may have a more general and wide-spread effect on this cause-specific morbidity than high temperature.},

An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes. A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study. The mean age of the participants was 37.7 {$\pm$} 14.0 years, and 74.9\% had a high level of education. The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 {$\pm$} 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact. Only 7.6\% of participants had an IES score {$\geq$}26. The majority of participants (53.3\%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic. On the other hand, 52.1\% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8\textendash 77.9\%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild stressful impact in our sample, even though the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. These findings would need to be verified in larger population studies.},
